abstract = {Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a primary covid-19 vaccine series plus booster doses with a primary series alone for the prevention of hospital admission with omicron related covid-19 in the United States. Design: Multicenter observational case-control study with a test negative design. Setting: Hospitals in 18 US states. Participants: 4760 adults admitted to one of 21 hospitals with acute respiratory symptoms between 26 December 2021 and 30 June 2022, a period when the omicron variant was dominant. Participants included 2385 (50.1%) patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19 (cases) and 2375 (49.9%) patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (controls). Main outcome measures: The main outcome was vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission with covid-19 for a primary series plus booster doses and a primary series alone by comparing the odds of being vaccinated with each of these regimens versus being unvaccinated among cases versus controls. Vaccine effectiveness analyses were stratified by immunosuppression status (immunocompetent, immunocompromised). The primary analysis evaluated all covid-19 vaccine types combined, and secondary analyses evaluated specific vaccine products. Results: Overall, median age of participants was 64 years (interquartile range 52-75 years), 994 (20.8%) were immunocompromised, 85 (1.8%) were vaccinated with a primary series plus two boosters, 1367 (28.7%) with a primary series plus one booster, and 1875 (39.3%) with a primary series alone, and 1433 (30.1%) were unvaccinated. Among immunocompetent participants, vaccine effectiveness for prevention of hospital admission with omicron related covid-19 for a primary series plus two boosters was 63% (95% confidence interval 37% to 78%), a primary series plus one booster was 65% (58% to 71%), and for a primary series alone was 37% (25% to 47%) (P<0.001 for the pooled boosted regimens compared with a primary series alone). Vaccine effectiveness was higher for a boosted regimen than for a primary series alone for both mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech): 73% (44% to 87%) for primary series plus two boosters, 64% (55% to 72%) for primary series plus one booster, and 36% (21% to 48%) for primary series alone (P<0.001); mRNA-1273 (Moderna): 68% (17% to 88%) for primary series plus two boosters, 65% (55% to 73%) for primary series plus one booster, and 41% (25% to 54%) for primary series alone (P=0.001)). Among immunocompromised patients, vaccine effectiveness for a primary series plus one booster was 69% (31% to 86%) and for a primary series alone was 49% (30% to 63%) (P=0.04). Conclusion: During the first six months of 2022 in the US, booster doses of a covid-19 vaccine provided additional benefit beyond a primary vaccine series alone for preventing hospital admissions with omicron related covid-19.

abstract = {Given the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants and the roll-out of booster COVID-19 vaccination, evidence is needed on protection conferred by primary vaccination, booster vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by variant. We employed a test-negative design on S-gene target failure data from community PCR testing in the Netherlands from 22 November 2021 to 31 March 2022 (n = 671,763). Previous infection, primary vaccination or both protected well against Delta infection. Protection against Omicron BA.1 infection was much lower compared to Delta. Protection was similar against Omicron BA.1 compared to BA.2 infection after previous infection, primary and booster vaccination. Higher protection was observed against all variants in individuals with both vaccination and previous infection compared with either one. Protection against all variants decreased over time since last vaccination or infection. We found that primary vaccination with current COVID-19 vaccines and previous SARS-CoV-2 infections offered low protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 infection. Booster vaccination considerably increased protection against Omicron infection, but decreased rapidly after vaccination.},

abstract = {Concerns about the duration of protection conferred by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have arisen in postlicensure evaluations. "Depletion of susceptibles,"a bias driven by differential accrual of infection among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, may obscure vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates, hindering interpretation. We enrolled California residents who received molecular SARS-CoV-2 tests in a matched, test-negative design, case-control study to estimate VE of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines between February 23 and December 5, 2021. We analyzed waning protection following 2 vaccine doses using conditional logistic regression models. Additionally, we used data from a population-based serological study to adjust for "depletion-of-susceptibles"bias and estimated VE for 3 doses, by time since second dose receipt. Pooled VE of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 91.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83.8, 95.4) at 14 days after second-dose receipt and declined to 50.8% (95% CI: 19.7, 69.8) at 7 months. Adjusting for depletion-of-susceptibles bias, we estimated VE of 53.2% (95% CI: 23.6, 71.2) at 7 months after primary mRNA vaccination series. A booster dose of BN162b2 or mRNA-1273 increased VE to 95.0% (95% CI: 82.8, 98.6). These findings confirm that observed waning of protection is not attributable to epidemiologic bias and support ongoing efforts to administer additional vaccine doses to mitigate burden of COVID-19.},

We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate the relative effectiveness of a booster dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) compared to only a two-dose primary course (at least 175 days after the second dose) or unvaccinated individuals from 13 September 2021 to 5 December 2021, when Delta variant was dominant in circulation. Outcomes were symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and hospitalization. The relative effectiveness against symptomatic disease 14–34 days after a BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) booster after a ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca) and BNT162b2 as a primary course ranged from around 85% to 95%. Absolute vaccine effectiveness ranged from 94% to 97% and was similar in all age groups. Limited waning was seen 10 or more weeks after the booster. Against hospitalization or death, absolute effectiveness of a BNT162b2 booster ranged from around 97% to 99% in all age groups irrespective of the primary course, with no evidence of waning up to 10 weeks. This study provides real-world evidence of substantially increased protection from the booster vaccine dose against mild and severe disease irrespective of the primary course.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), have been used since December 2020 in the United Kingdom. Real-world data have shown the vaccines to be highly effective against Covid-19 and related severe disease and death. Vaccine effectiveness may wane over time since the receipt of the second dose of the ChAdOx1-S (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and BNT162b2 vaccines. METHODS We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 and related hospitalization and death in England. Effectiveness of the ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 vaccines was assessed according to participant age and status with regard to coexisting conditions and over time since receipt of the second vaccine dose to investigate waning of effectiveness separately for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants. RESULTS Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 with the delta variant peaked in the early weeks after receipt of the second dose and then decreased by 20 weeks to 44.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.2 to 45.4) with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine and to 66.3% (95% CI, 65.7 to 66.9) with the BNT162b2 vaccine. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was greater in persons 65 years of age or older than in those 40 to 64 years of age. At 20 weeks or more after vaccination, vaccine effectiveness decreased less against both hospitalization, to 80.0% (95% CI, 76.8 to 82.7) with the ChAdOx1-S vaccine and 91.7% (95% CI, 90.2 to 93.0) with the BNT162b2 vaccine, and death, to 84.8% (95% CI, 76.2 to 90.3) and 91.9% (95% CI, 88.5 to 94.3), respectively. Greater waning in vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was observed in persons 65 years of age or older in a clinically extremely vulnerable group and in persons 40 to 64 years of age with underlying medical conditions than in healthy adults. CONCLUSIONS We observed limited waning in vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19-related hospitalization and death at 20 weeks or more after vaccination with two doses of the ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2 vaccine. Waning was greater in older adults and in those in a clinical risk group.},

abstract = {Background: Although several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines initially showed high efficacy, there have been concerns because of waning immunity and the emergence of variants with immune escape capacity. Methods: A test-negative design case-control study was conducted in 16 healthcare facilities in Japan during the Delta-dominant period (August-September 2021) and the Omicron-dominant period (January-March 2022). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was calculated for 2 doses for the Delta-dominant period and 2 or 3 doses for the Omicron-dominant period compared with unvaccinated individuals. Results: The analysis included 5795 individuals with 2595 (44.8%) cases. Among vaccinees, 2242 (55.8%) received BNT162b2 and 1624 (40.4%) received messenger RNA (mRNA)-1273 at manufacturer-recommended intervals. During the Delta-dominant period, VE was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82-93) 14 days to 3 months after dose 2 and 87% (95% CI, 38-97) 3 to 6 months after dose 2. During the Omicron-dominant period, VE was 56% (95% CI, 37-70) 14 days to 3 months since dose 2, 52% (95% CI, 40-62) 3 to 6 months after dose 2, 49% (95% CI, 34-61) 6+ months after dose 2, and 74% (95% CI, 62-83) 14+ days after dose 3. Restricting to individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and additional adjustment for preventive measures (ie, mask wearing/high-risk behaviors) yielded similar estimates, respectively. Conclusions: In Japan, where most are infection-na{\"{i}}ve, and strict prevention measures are maintained regardless of vaccination status, 2-dose mRNA vaccines provided high protection against symptomatic infection during the Delta-dominant period and moderate protection during the Omicron-dominant period. Among individuals who received an mRNA booster dose, VE recovered to a high level.},

abstract = {Waning immunity following administration of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines remains a concern for many health systems. We undertook a study to determine if recent reports of waning for severe disease could have been attributed to design-related bias by conducting a study only among those detected with a first SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used a matched case-control study design with the study base being all individuals with first infection with SARS-CoV-2 reported in the State of Qatar between 1 January 2021 and 20 February 2022. Cases were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring intensive care (hard outcome), while controls were those detected with first SARS-CoV-2 infection who recovered without the need for intensive care. Cases and controls were matched in a 1:30 ratio for the calendar month of infection and the comorbidity category. Duration and magnitude of conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care and the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one more case of COVID-19 requiring intensive care was estimated for the mRNA (BNT162b2/mRNA-1273) vaccines. Conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care was 59% (95% confidence interval (CI), 50 to 76) between the first and second dose, and strengthened to 89% (95% CI, 85 to 92) between the second dose and 4 months post the second dose in persons who received a primary course of the vaccine. There was no waning of vaccine effectiveness in the period from 4 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 months after the second dose. This study demonstrates that, contrary to mainstream reports using hierar-chical measures of effectiveness, conditional vaccine effectiveness against requiring intensive care remains robust till at least 12 months after the second dose of mRNA-based vaccines.},

abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection within controlled trials and real-world vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies. Recent reports have estimated reduced VE with the emergence and dissemination of the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta variant). During July 2021, Multnomah County experienced an epidemic expansion coinciding with increased Delta variant prevalence. We assess COVID-19 VE during this time. Methods: A test-negative design (TND) matched case-control analysis was performed to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection during July 2021. Cases included a random sample of individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were reported by electronic laboratory report, were &gt;15 years of age, and had no prior known SARS-CoV-2 infections. Controls were age and postal code matched individuals that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 during July 2021. Immunization status was assessed using the Oregon ALERT Immunization Information system (ALERT IIS). Results: 500 case-control pairs were matched (n=1000). Overall effectiveness of any completed COVID-19 immunization was 73% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 49-86%) and 74% (95% CI 65-85%) for mRNA immunizations and 72% (95% CI 47-85%) for individuals that had started but not completed mRNA immunizations. Conclusions: Our findings estimate high, yet reduced, VE during Delta variant dissemination. These results highlight the importance of COVID-19 immunizations for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection while juxtaposing the need for additional non-pharmaceutical interventions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Vaccination has been effective in ameliorating the impact of COVID-19. However, estimation of vaccine effectiveness (VE) is still unavailable for some widely used vaccines and underrepresented groups. Here, we report on the effectiveness of a nation-wide COVID-19 vaccination program in Mexico. METHODS We used a test-negative design within a national COVID-19 surveillance system to assess VE of the BNT162b2, mRNA-12732, Gam-COVID-Vac, Ad5-nCoV, Ad26.COV2.S, ChAdOx1 and CoronaVac vaccines, against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalization and death for adults ≥18 years in Mexico. VE was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models considering time-varying vaccination status in partial and fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated adults, adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities and municipality. We also estimated VE for adults ≥60 years, for cases with diabetes and comparing periods with predominance of variants B.1.1.519 and B.1.617.2. RESULTS We assessed 793,487 vaccinated compared to 4,792,338 unvaccinated adults between December 24th, 2020, and September 27th, 2021. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection was highest for fully vaccinated individuals with mRNA-12732 (91.5%, 95%CI 90.3-92.4) and Ad26.COV2.S (82.2%, 95%CI 81.4-82.9), whereas for COVID-19 related hospitalization were BNT162b2 (84.3%, 95%CI 83.6-84.9) and Gam-COVID-Vac (81.4% 95%CI 79.5-83.1) and for mortality BNT162b2 (89.8%, 95%CI 89.2-90.2) and mRNA-12732 (93.5%, 95%CI 86.0-97.0). VE for all evaluated vaccines was reduced for adults ≥60 years, people with diabetes, and in periods of Delta variant predominance. CONCLUSIONS All evaluated vaccines were effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death. Mass vaccination campaigns with multiple vaccine products are feasible and effective to maximize vaccination coverage. ### Competing Interest Statement SECL, GCS, CAZJ, GGR, RCA and HLG work at the Mexican Ministry of Health and oversee monitoring SARS-Cov-2 epidemiological surveillance and designing COVID-19 vaccination policies in Mexico.

abstract = {Studies demonstrating the waning of post-vaccination and post-infection immunity against covid-19 generally analyzed a limited range of vaccines or subsets of populations. Using Czech national health data from the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic till November 20, 2021 we estimated the risks of reinfection, breakthrough infection, hospitalization and death by a Cox regression adjusted for sex, age, vaccine type and vaccination status. Vaccine effectiveness against infection declined from 87% at 0-2 months after the second dose to 53% at 7-8 months for BNT162b2 vaccine, from 90% at 0-2 months to 65% at 7-8 months for mRNA-1273, and from 83% at 0-2 months to 55% at 5-6 months for the ChAdOx1-S. Effectiveness against hospitalization and deaths declined by about 15% and 10%, respectively, during the first 6-8 months. Boosters (third dose) returned the protection to the levels observed shortly after dose 2. In unvaccinated, previously infected individuals the protection against infection declined from 97% after 2 months to 72% at 18 months. Our results confirm the waning of vaccination-induced immunity against infection and a smaller decline in the protection against hospitalization and death. Boosting restores the original vaccine effectiveness. Post-infection immunity also decreases over time.},

Design Test negative case-control study. Setting Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), an integrated healthcare system. Participants Adult KPSC members with a SARS-CoV-2 positive test sent for whole genome sequencing or a negative test from 1 March 2021 to 27 July 2021. Interventions Two dose or one dose vaccination with mRNA-1273 (Moderna covid-19 vaccine) ≥14 days before specimen collection versus no covid-19 vaccination. Main outcome measures Outcomes included infection with SARS-CoV-2 and hospital admission with covid-19. In pre-specified analyses for each variant type, test positive cases were matched 1:5 to test negative controls on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and specimen collection date. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare odds of vaccination among cases versus controls, with adjustment for confounders. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-odds ratio)×100%. Results The study included 8153 cases and their matched controls. Two dose vaccine effectiveness was 86.7% (95% confidence interval 84.3% to 88.7%) against infection with the delta variant, 98.4% (96.9% to 99.1%) against alpha, 90.4% (73.9% to 96.5%) against mu, 96-98% against other identified variants, and 79.9% (76.9% to 82.5%) against unidentified variants (that is, specimens that failed sequencing). Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission with the delta variant was 97.5% (92.7% to 99.2%). Vaccine effectiveness against infection with the delta variant declined from 94.1% (90.5% to 96.3%) 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% (70.2% to 86.6%) 151-180 days after vaccination. Waning was less pronounced for non-delta variants. Vaccine effectiveness against delta infection was lower among people aged ≥65 years (75.2%, 59.6% to 84.8%) than those aged 18-64 years (87.9%, 85.5% to 89.9%). One dose vaccine effectiveness was 77.0% (60.7% to 86.5%) against infection with delta. Conclusions Two doses of mRNA-1273 were highly effective against all SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially against hospital admission with covid-19. However, vaccine effectiveness against infection with the delta variant moderately declined with increasing time since vaccination.},

abstract = {Importance: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including among individuals who have received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, increased substantially following the emergence of the Omicron variant in Ontario, Canada. Understanding the estimated effectiveness of 2 or 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine against outcomes associated with Omicron and Delta infections may aid decision-making at the individual and population levels. Objective: To estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infections due to the Omicron and Delta variants and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) associated with these infections. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test-negative case-control study used linked provincial databases for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing, reportable disease, COVID-19 vaccination, and health administration in Ontario, Canada. Participants were individuals aged 18 years or older who had COVID-19 symptoms or severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between December 6 and 26, 2021. Exposures: Receipt of 2 or 3 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine and time since last dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were symptomatic Omicron or Delta infection and severe outcomes (hospitalization or death) associated with infection. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effectiveness of 2 or 3 COVID-19 vaccine doses by time since the latest dose compared with no vaccination. Estimated VE was calculated using the formula VE = (1 - [adjusted odds ratio]) × 100%. Results: Of 134435 total participants, 16087 were Omicron-positive cases (mean [SD] age, 36.0 [14.1] years; 8249 [51.3%] female), 4261 were Delta-positive cases (mean [SD] age, 44.2 [16.8] years; 2199 [51.6%] female), and 114087 were test-negative controls (mean [SD] age, 42.0 [16.5] years; 67884 [59.5%] female). Estimated VE against symptomatic Delta infection decreased from 89% (95% CI, 86%-92%) 7 to 59 days after a second dose to 80% (95% CI, 74%-84%) after 240 or more days but increased to 97% (95% CI, 96%-98%) 7 or more days after a third dose. Estimated VE against symptomatic Omicron infection was 36% (95% CI, 24%-45%) 7 to 59 days after a second dose and 1% (95% CI, -8% to 10%) after 180 days or longer, but 7 or more days after a third dose, it increased to 61% (95% CI, 56%-65%). Estimated VE against severe outcomes was high 7 or more days after a third dose for both Delta (99%; 95% CI, 98%-99%) and Omicron (95%; 95% CI, 87%-98%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, in contrast to high estimated VE against symptomatic Delta infection and severe outcomes after 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, estimated VE was modest and short term against symptomatic Omicron infection but better maintained against severe outcomes. A third dose was associated with improved estimated VE against symptomatic infection and with high estimated VE against severe outcomes for both variants. Preventing infection due to Omicron and potential future variants may require tools beyond the currently available vaccines..},

abstract = {Background: There is a paucity of data on vaccine-induced or infection-induced (hybrid or natural) immunity against omicron (B.1.1.529) subvariant BA.2, particularly in comparing the effects of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with the same or different genetic lineage. We aimed to estimate the protection against omicron BA.2 associated with previous primary infection with omicron BA.1 or pre-omicron SARS-CoV-2, among health-care workers with and without mRNA vaccination. Methods: We conducted a test-negative case-control study among health-care workers aged 18 years or older who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, Canada, between March 27 and June 4, 2022, when BA.2 was the predominant variant and was presumptively diagnosed with a positive test result. We identified cases (positive test during study period) and controls (negative test during study period) using the provincial laboratory database that records all nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Quebec, and used the provincial immunisation registry to determine vaccination status. Logistic regression models compared the likelihood of BA.2 infection or reinfection (second positive test ≥30 days after primary infection) among health-care workers who had previous primary infection and none to three mRNA vaccine doses versus unvaccinated health-care workers with no primary infection. Findings: 258 007 SARS-CoV-2 tests were done during the study period. Among those with a valid result and that met the inclusion criteria, there were 37 732 presumed BA.2 cases (2521 [6{\textperiodcentered}7%] reinfections following pre-omicron primary infection and 659 [1{\textperiodcentered}7%] reinfections following BA.1 primary infection) and 73 507 controls (7360 [10{\textperiodcentered}0%] had pre-omicron primary infection and 12 315 [16{\textperiodcentered}8%] had BA.1 primary infection). Pre-omicron primary infection was associated with a 38% (95% CI 19–53) reduction in BA.2 infection risk, with higher BA.2 protection among those who had also received one (56%, 95% CI 47–63), two (69%, 64–73), or three (70%, 66–74) mRNA vaccine doses. Omicron BA.1 primary infection was associated with greater protection against BA.2 infection (risk reduction of 72%, 95% CI 65–78), and protection was increased further among those who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine (96%, 95–96), but was not improved with a third dose (96%, 95–97). Interpretation: Health-care workers who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine and had previous BA.1 infection were subsequently well protected for a prolonged period against BA.2 reinfection, with a third vaccine dose conferring no improvement to that hybrid protection. If this protection also pertains to future variants, there might be limited benefit from additional vaccine doses for people with hybrid immunity, depending on timing and variant.

abstract = {Background: In Canada, first and second doses of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were uniquely spaced 16 weeks apart. We estimated 1-and 2-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Quebec, Canada, including protection against varying outcome severity, variants of concern (VOCs), and the stability of single-dose protection up to 16 weeks postvaccination. Methods: A test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and weekly matched (10:1), randomly sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by 1 dose ≥14 days or 2 doses ≥7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: Primary analysis included 5316 cases and 53 160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68%-73%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection; 73% (95% CI, 71%-75%) against illness; and 97% (95% CI, 92%-99%) against hospitalization. Two-dose VE was 86% (95% CI, 81%-90%) and 93% (95% CI, 89%-95%), respectively, with no hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOCs than VOCs (73% Alpha) among single-dose recipients but not 2-dose recipients. Across 16 weeks, no decline in single-dose VE was observed, with appropriate stratification based upon prioritized vaccination determined by higher vs lower likelihood of direct patient contact. Conclusions: One mRNA vaccine dose provided substantial and sustained protection to HCWs extending at least 4 months postvaccination. In circumstances of vaccine shortage, delaying the second dose may be a pertinent public health strategy.},

Design: Test negative, case-control study. Setting: Database of the National Surveillance System and the Nominalized Federal Vaccination Registry of Argentina. Participants: 844 460 children and adolescents without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection eligible to receive primary vaccination schedule who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test from September 2021 to April 2022. After matching with their corresponding controls, 139 321 (60.3%) of 231 181 cases remained for analysis. Exposures: Two dose mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and BBIBP-CorV vaccination schedule. Main outcome measures: SARS-CoV-2 infection and covid-19 related death. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among two dose vaccinated and unvaccinated participants.

abstract = {Background: COVID-19 vaccines have proven highly effective among individuals without a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infection and severe outcomes among individuals with previous infection is less clear. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of four COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic infection, hospitalisation, and death for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Using national COVID-19 notification, hospitalisation, and vaccination datasets from Brazil, we did a test-negative, case-control study to assess the effectiveness of four vaccines (CoronaVac [Sinovac], ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AstraZeneca], Ad26.COV2.S [Janssen], and BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech]) for individuals with laboratory-confirmed previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched cases with RT-PCR positive, symptomatic COVID-19 with up to ten controls with negative RT-PCR tests who presented with symptomatic illnesses, restricting both groups to tests done at least 90 days after an initial infection. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of test positivity and the odds of hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19, according to vaccination status and time since first or second dose of vaccines. Findings: Between Feb 24, 2020, and Nov 11, 2021, we identified 213 457 individuals who had a subsequent, symptomatic illness with RT-PCR testing done at least 90 days after their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and after the vaccination programme started. Among these, 30 910 (14{\textperiodcentered}5%) had a positive RT-PCR test consistent with reinfection, and we matched 22 566 of these cases with 145 055 negative RT-PCR tests from 68 426 individuals as controls. Among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 39{\textperiodcentered}4% (95% CI 36{\textperiodcentered}1–42{\textperiodcentered}6) for CoronaVac, 56{\textperiodcentered}0% (51{\textperiodcentered}4–60{\textperiodcentered}2) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 44{\textperiodcentered}0% (31{\textperiodcentered}5–54{\textperiodcentered}2) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 64{\textperiodcentered}8% (54{\textperiodcentered}9–72{\textperiodcentered}4) for BNT162b2. For the two-dose vaccine series (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and BNT162b2), effectiveness against symptomatic infection was significantly greater after the second dose than after the first dose. Effectiveness against hospitalisation or death 14 or more days from vaccine series completion was 81{\textperiodcentered}3% (75{\textperiodcentered}3–85{\textperiodcentered}8) for CoronaVac, 89{\textperiodcentered}9% (83{\textperiodcentered}5–93{\textperiodcentered}8) for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 57{\textperiodcentered}7% (−2{\textperiodcentered}6 to 82{\textperiodcentered}5) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 89{\textperiodcentered}7% (54{\textperiodcentered}3–97{\textperiodcentered}7) for BNT162b2. Interpretation: All four vaccines conferred additional protection against symptomatic infections and severe outcomes among individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The provision of a full vaccine series to individuals after recovery from COVID-19 might reduce morbidity and mortality.

Methods and findings Using a test-negative design, we analyzed national databases to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a primary series (with ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2) plus an mRNA vaccine booster (with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) against symptomatic SevereAU Acute: Pleasenotethat Respiratory SARS Co Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes (hospitalization or death) during the period of Omicron dominance in Brazil and Scotland compared to unvaccinated individuals. Additional analyses included stratification by age group (18 to 49, 50 to 64, 65). All individuals aged 18 years or older who reported acute respiratory illness symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 1, 2022, and April 23, 2022, in Brazil and Scotland were eligible for the study. At 14 to 29 days after the mRNA booster, the VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of ChAdOx1 plus BNT162b2 booster was 51.6%, (95% confidence interval (CI): [51.0, 52.2], p < 0.001) in Brazil and 67.1% (95% CI [65.5, 68.5], p < 0.001) in Scotland. At 4 months, protection against symptomatic infection waned to 4.2% (95% CI [0.7, 7.6], p = 0.02) in Brazil and 37.4% (95% CI [33.8, 40.9], p < 0.001) in Scotland. VE against severe outcomes in Brazil was 93.5% (95% CI [93.0, 94.0], p < 0.001) at 14 to 29 days post-booster, decreasing to 82.3% (95% CI [79.7, 84.7], p < 0.001) and 98.3% (95% CI [87.3, 99.8], p < 0.001) to 77.8% (95% CI [51.4, 89.9], p < 0.001) in Scotland for the same periods. Similar results were obtained with the primary series of BNT162b2 plus homologous booster. Potential limitations of this study were that we assumed that all cases included in the analysis were due to the Omicron variant based on the period of dominance and the limited follow-up time since the booster dose. Conclusions We observed that mRNA boosters after a primary vaccination course with either mRNA or viral-vector vaccines provided modest, short-lived protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron but substantial and more sustained protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes for at least 3 months.},

abstract = {Objective:People with HIV were underrepresented in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 vaccines among a population-based cohort of people with HIV in Ontario, Canada.Design:Test-negative designMethods:We identified people with HIV aged ≥19 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR between December 14, 2020 (first availability of COVID-19 vaccines) and November 21, 2021 (pre-Omicron circulation). Outcomes included any infection, symptomatic infection, and COVID-19-related hospitalization/death. We compared the odds of vaccination between test-positive cases and test-negative controls using multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, region, calendar time, SARS-CoV-2 test histories, influenza vaccination, comorbidities, and neighborhood-level socio-economic status. VE was derived as (1 - adjusted odds ratio) × 100%.Results:Among 21 023 adults living with HIV, there were 801 (8.3%) test-positive cases and 8,879 (91.7%) test-negative controls. 20.1% cases and 47.8% of controls received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; among two-dose recipients, 93.4% received ≥1 mRNA dose. Two-dose VE ≥7 days before specimen collection was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74-87%) against any infection, 94% (95% CI = 82-98%) against symptomatic infection, and 97% (95% CI = 85-100%) against hospitalization/death. Against any infection, VE declined from 86% (95% CI = 77-92%) within 7-59 days after the second dose to 66% (95% CI = -15-90%) after ≥180 days; we did not observe evidence of waning protection for other outcomes.Conclusion:Two doses of COVID-19 vaccine offered substantial protection against symptomatic illness and hospitalization/death in people with HIV prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Our findings do not support a broad conclusion that COVID-19 VE is lower among people with HIV in populations that, for the most part, are attending HIV care, taking antiretroviral medication, and are virally suppressed.},

abstract = {Background: The BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for children 5-11 years of age and adolescents 12-17 years of age, but in different dose sizes. We assessed BNT162b2 real-world effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection among children and adolescents in Qatar. Methods: Three matched, retrospective, target-trial, cohort studies were conducted to compare incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national cohort of vaccinated individuals to incidence in the national cohort of unvaccinated individuals. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Results: Effectiveness of the 10 micrograms dose for children against Omicron infection was 25.7% (95% CI: 10.0-38.6%). It was highest at 49.6% (95% CI: 28.5-64.5%) right after the second dose, but waned rapidly thereafter and was negligible after 3 months. Effectiveness was 46.3% (95% CI: 21.5-63.3%) among those aged 5-7 years and 16.6% (-4.2-33.2%) among those aged 8-11 years. Effectiveness of the 30 micrograms dose for adolescents against Omicron infection was 30.6% (95% CI: 26.9-34.1%), but many adolescents were vaccinated months earlier. Effectiveness waned with time after the second dose. Effectiveness was 35.6% (95% CI: 31.2-39.6%) among those aged 12-14 years and 20.9% (13.8-27.4%) among those aged 15-17 years. Effectiveness of the 30 micrograms dose for adolescents against pre-Omicron infection was 87.6% (95% CI: 84.0-90.4%) and waned relatively slowly after the second dose. Conclusions: Pediatric vaccination is associated with modest and rapidly waning protection against Omicron infection. Adolescent vaccination is associated with stronger and more durable protection, perhaps because of the larger dose size. Age at such young age appears to play a role in determining vaccine protection, with greater protection observed in younger than older children or adolescents.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe authors are grateful for institutional salary support from the Biomedical Research Program and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Biomathematics Research Core, both at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, as well as for institutional salary support provided by the Ministry of Public Health, Hamad Medical Corporation, and Sidra Medicine.

abstract = {Background: The future of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic hinges on virus evolution and duration of immune protection of natural infection against reinfection. We investigated the duration of protection afforded by natural infection, the effect of viral immune evasion on duration of protection and protection against severe reinfection, in Qatar, between 28 February 2020 and 5 June 2022. Methods: Three national, matched, retrospective cohort studies were conducted to compare the incidence of SARSCoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity among unvaccinated persons with a documented SARS-CoV-2 primary infection, to incidence among those infection-na{\"{i}}ve and unvaccinated. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: Effectiveness of pre-Omicron primary infection against pre-Omicron reinfection was 85.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 84.8-86.2%]. Effectiveness peaked at 90.5% (95% CI: 88.4-92.3%) in the 7th month after the primary infection, but waned to ∼ 70% by the 16th month. Extrapolating this waning trend using a Gompertz curve suggested an effectiveness of 50% in the 22nd month and < 10% by the 32nd month. Effectiveness of pre-Omicron primary infection against Omicron reinfection was 38.1% (95% CI: 36.3-39.8%) and declined with time since primary infection. A Gompertz curve suggested an effectiveness of < 10% by the 15th month. Effectiveness of primary infection against severe, critical or fatal COVID-19 reinfection was 97.3% (95% CI: 94.9-98.6%), irrespective of the variant of primary infection or reinfection, and with no evidence for waning. Similar results were found in sub-group analyses for those ≥50 years of age. Conclusions: Protection of natural infection against reinfection wanes and may diminish within a few years. Viral immune evasion accelerates this waning. Protection against severe reinfection remains very strong, with no evidence for waning, irrespective of variant, for over 14 months after primary infection.},

METHODS We used a matched test-negative, case-control study design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection and against any severe, critical, or fatal case of Covid-19, from January 1 to September 5, 2021. RESULTS Estimated BNT162b2 effectiveness against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was negligible in the first 2 weeks after the first dose. It increased to 36.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.2 to 40.2) in the third week after the first dose and reached its peak at 77.5% (95% CI, 76.4 to 78.6) in the first month after the second dose. Effectiveness declined gradually thereafter, with the decline accelerating after the fourth month to reach approximately 20% in months 5 through 7 after the second dose. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was higher than effectiveness against asymptomatic infection but waned similarly. Variant-specific effectiveness waned in the same pattern. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal case of Covid-19 increased rapidly to 66.1% (95% CI, 56.8 to 73.5) by the third week after the first dose and reached 96% or higher in the first 2 months after the second dose; effectiveness persisted at approximately this level for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS BNT162b2-induced protection against SARS-COV-2 infection appeared to wane rapidly following its peak after the second dose, but protection against hospitalization and death persisted at a robust level for 6 months after the second dose.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Information regarding the protection conferred by vaccination and previous infection against infection with the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is limited. METHODS We evaluated the protection conferred by mRNA vaccines and previous infection against infection with the omicron variant in two high-risk populations: residents and staff in the California state prison system. We used a retrospective cohort design to analyze the risk of infection during the omicron wave using data collected from December 24, 2021, through April 14, 2022. Weighted Cox models were used to compare the effectiveness (measured as 1 minus the hazard ratio) of vaccination and previous infection across combinations of vaccination history (stratified according to the number of mRNA doses received) and infection history (none or infection before or during the period of B.1.617.2 [delta]-variant predominance). A secondary analysis used a rolling matched-cohort design to evaluate the effectiveness of three vaccine doses as compared with two doses. RESULTS Among 59,794 residents and 16,572 staff, the estimated effectiveness of previous infection against omicron infection among unvaccinated persons who had been infected before or during the period of delta predominance ranged from 16.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.1 to 23.7) to 48.9% (95% CI, 41.6 to 55.3). Depending on previous infection status, the estimated effectiveness of vaccination (relative to being unvaccinated and without previous documented infection) ranged from 18.6% (95% CI, 7.7 to 28.1) to 83.2% (95% CI, 77.7 to 87.4) with two vaccine doses and from 40.9% (95% CI, 31.9 to 48.7) to 87.9% (95% CI, 76.0 to 93.9) with three vaccine doses. Incremental effectiveness estimates of a third (booster) dose (relative to two doses) ranged from 25.0% (95% CI, 16.6 to 32.5) to 57.9% (95% CI, 48.4 to 65.7) among persons who either had not had previous documented infection or had been infected before the period of delta predominance. CONCLUSIONS Our findings in two high-risk populations suggest that mRNA vaccination and previous infection were effective against omicron infection, with lower estimates among those infected before the period of delta predominance. Three vaccine doses offered significantly more protection than two doses, including among previously infected persons.},

abstract = {Background. Waning protection from 2 doses of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines led to third dose availability in multiple countries even before the emergence of the Omicron variant. Methods. We used the test-negative study design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against any severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, any symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (COVID-19-related hospitalizations or death) by time since second dose of any combination of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 between January 11, and November 21, 2021, for subgroups based on patient and vaccine characteristics. Results. We included 261 360 test-positive cases (of any SARS-CoV-2 lineage) and 2 783 699 individuals as test-negative controls. VE of 2 mRNA vaccine doses decreased from 90% (95% CI, 90%-90%) 7-59 days after the second dose to 75% (95% CI, 72%-78%) after ≥240 days against infection, decreased from 94% (95% CI, 84%-95%) to 87% (95% CI, 85%-89%) against symptomatic infection, and remained stable (98% [95% CI, 97%-98%] to 98% [95% CI, 96%-99%]) against severe outcomes. Similar trends were seen with heterologous ChAdOx1 and mRNA vaccine schedules. VE estimates for dosing intervals <35 days were lower than for longer intervals (eg, VE of 2 mRNA vaccines against symptomatic infection at 120-179 days was 86% [95% CI, 85%-88%] for dosing intervals <35 days, 92% [95% CI, 91%-93%] for 35-55 days, and 91% [95% CI, 90%-92%] for ≥56 days), but when stratified by age group and subperiod, there were no differences between dosing intervals. Conclusions. Before the emergence of Omicron, VE of any 2-dose primary series, including heterologous schedules and varying dosing intervals, decreased over time against any infection and symptomatic infection but remained high against severe outcomes.},

Methods: Symptomatic outpatients aged ≥12 years reporting acute onset of COVID-19-like illness and tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 1 and September 30, 2021 were enrolled. Participants were stratified by self-report of having known contact with a COVID-19 case in the 14 days prior to illness onset.

abstract = {Background: Immunocompromised (IC) persons are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes and are less protected by 1–2 COVID-19 vaccine doses than are immunocompetent (non-IC) persons. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended COVID-19 of 2–3 mRNA and 1–2 viral-vector vaccine doses between IC and non-IC adults. Methods: Using a test-negative design among eight VISION Network sites, VE against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated emergency department (ED) or urgent care (UC) events and hospitalizations from 26 August-25 December 2021 was estimated separately among IC and non-IC adults and among specific IC condition subgroups. Vaccination status was defined using number and timing of doses. VE for each status (versus unvaccinated) was adjusted for age, geography, time, prior positive test result, and local SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Results: We analyzed 8,848 ED/UC events and 18,843 hospitalizations among IC patients and 200,071 ED/UC events and 70,882 hospitalizations among non-IC patients. Among IC patients, 3-dose mRNA VE against ED/UC (73% [95% CI: 64–80]) and hospitalization (81% [95% CI: 76–86]) was lower than that among non-IC patients (ED/UC: 94% [95% CI: 93–94]; hospitalization: 96% [95% CI: 95–97]). Similar patterns were observed for viral-vector vaccines. Transplant recipients had lower VE than other IC subgroups. Conclusions: During B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant predominance, IC adults received moderate protection against COVID-19–associated medical events from three mRNA doses, or one viral-vector dose plus a second dose of any product. However, protection was lower in IC versus non-IC patients, especially among transplant recipients, underscoring the need for additional protection among IC adults.},

abstract = {Throughout the pandemic, individuals 65 years and older have contributed most COVID-19 related deaths. To best formulate effective vaccination and other prevention policies to protect older adults, large scale observational studies of these higher risk individuals are needed. We conducted a Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) study during the B.1.617.2 Delta variant phase of the pandemic in July and August 2021 in a cohort of 17 million Medicare beneficiaries of which 5.7 million were fully vaccinated. We found that individuals fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines in January 2021 had 2.5 times higher breakthrough infections and hospitalizations than those fully vaccinated in March 2021, consistent with waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Measuring VE weekly, we found that VE against hospitalization, and even more so against infection, increased from July 2021 through August 2021, suggesting that in addition to the protective role of vaccination, increased masking or social distancing might have contributed to the unexpected increase in VE. Ongoing monitoring of Medicare beneficiaries should be a priority as new variants continue to emerge, and the VE of the new bivalent vaccines remains to be established. This could be accomplished with a large Medicare claims database and the analytics platform used for this study.},

Setting Italy, 27 December 2020 to 7 November 2021. Participants 33 250 344 people aged ≥16 years who received a first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and did not have a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcome measures SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 (admission to hospital or death). Data were divided by weekly time intervals after vaccination. Incidence rate ratios at different time intervals were estimated by multilevel negative binomial models with robust variance estimator. Sex, age group, brand of vaccine, priority risk category, and regional weekly incidence in the general population were included as covariates. Geographic region was included as a random effect. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-IRR)×100, where IRR=incidence rate ratio, with the time interval 0-14 days after the first dose of vaccine as the reference. Results During the epidemic phase when the delta variant was the predominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly decreased (P<0.001) from 82% (95% confidence interval 80% to 84%) at 3-4 weeks after the second dose of vaccine to 33% (27% to 39%) at 27-30 weeks after the second dose. In the same time intervals, vaccine effectiveness against severe covid-19 also decreased (P<0.001), although to a lesser extent, from 96% (95% to 97%) to 80% (76% to 83%). High risk people (vaccine effectiveness -6%, -28% to 12%), those aged ≥80 years (11%, -15% to 31%), and those aged 60-79 years (2%, -11% to 14%) did not seem to be protected against infection at 27-30 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. Conclusions The results support the vaccination campaigns targeting high risk people, those aged ≥60 years, and healthcare workers to receive a booster dose of vaccine six months after the primary vaccination cycle. The results also suggest that timing the booster dose earlier than six months after the primary vaccination cycle and extending the offer of the booster dose to the wider eligible population might be warranted.},

abstract = {Background: Little is known about vaccine effectiveness over time among adolescents, especially against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. This study assessed the associations between time since two-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and the occurrence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland. Methods: We did test-negative, case-control studies in adolescents aged 12–17 years with COVID-19-related symptoms in Brazil and Scotland. We linked records of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antigen tests to national vaccination and clinical records. We excluded tests from individuals who did not have symptoms, were vaccinated before the start of the national vaccination programme, received vaccines other than BNT162b2 or a SARS-CoV-2 booster dose of any kind, or had an interval between their first and second dose of fewer than 21 days. Additionally, we excluded negative SARS-CoV-2 tests recorded within 14 days of a previous negative test, negative tests recorded within 7 days after a positive test, any test done within 90 days after a positive test, and tests with missing sex and location information. Cases (SARS-CoV-2 test-positive adolescents) and controls (test-negative adolescents) were drawn from a sample of individuals in whom tests were collected within 10 days of symptom onset. We estimated the adjusted odds ratio and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 for both countries and against severe COVID-19 (hospitalisation or death) for Brazil across fortnightly periods. Findings: We analysed 503 776 tests from 2 948 538 adolescents in Brazil between Sept 2, 2021, and April 19, 2022, and 127 168 tests from 404 673 adolescents in Scotland between Aug 6, 2021, and April 19, 2022. Vaccine effectiveness peaked at 14–27 days after the second dose in both countries during both waves, and was significantly lower against symptomatic infection during the omicron-dominant period in Brazil (64{\textperiodcentered}7% [95% CI 63{\textperiodcentered}0–66{\textperiodcentered}3]) and in Scotland (82{\textperiodcentered}6% [80{\textperiodcentered}6–84{\textperiodcentered}5]), than it was in the delta-dominant period (80{\textperiodcentered}7% [95% CI 77{\textperiodcentered}8–83{\textperiodcentered}3] in Brazil and 92{\textperiodcentered}8% [85{\textperiodcentered}7–96{\textperiodcentered}4] in Scotland). Vaccine efficacy started to decline from 27 days after the second dose for both countries, reducing to 5{\textperiodcentered}9% (95% CI 2{\textperiodcentered}2–9{\textperiodcentered}4) in Brazil and 50{\textperiodcentered}6% (42{\textperiodcentered}7–57{\textperiodcentered}4) in Scotland at 98 days or more during the omicron-dominant period. In Brazil, protection against severe disease remained above 80% from 28 days after the second dose and was 82{\textperiodcentered}7% (95% CI 68{\textperiodcentered}8–90{\textperiodcentered}4) at 98 days or more after receiving the second dose. Interpretation: We found waning vaccine protection of BNT162b2 against symptomatic COVID-19 infection among adolescents in Brazil and Scotland from 27 days after the second dose. However, protection against severe COVID-19 outcomes remained high at 98 days or more after the second dose in the omicron-dominant period. Booster doses for adolescents need to be considered.

abstract = {Objective: To examine the relative effectiveness of a fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (BNT162b2) vaccine compared with three vaccine doses over the span of 10 weeks. Design: Retrospective, test negative, case-control study, with a matched analysis and an unmatched multiple tests analysis. Setting: Nationally centralised database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli national health fund for 2.5 million people; from 10 January 2022 (seven days after the fourth dose was first given to eligible individuals) to 13 March 2022, an omicron dominant period in Israel. Participants: 97 499 Maccabi Healthcare Services members aged 60 years and older, who were eligible to receive a fourth vaccine dose and obtained at least one polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test during the study. Main outcome measures: Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a positive PCR test performed seven or more days after inoculation with the BNT162b2 vaccine; and breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in severe covid-19 disease, defined as hospital admission or death related to covid-19. Results: 27 876 participants received the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose and 69 623 received three doses only. Of 106 participants who died during the follow-up period, 77 had had their third doses only and 23 had had their fourth doses during the first three weeks after inoculation. In the first three weeks, a fourth dose provided additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease relative to three doses of the vaccine. However, relative vaccine effectiveness against infection quickly decreased over time, peaking during the third week at 65.1% (95% confidence interval 63.0% to 67.1%) and falling to 22.0% (4.9% to 36.1%) by the end of the 10 week follow-up period. Unlike relative effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection, the relative effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe covid-19 was maintained at a high level (>72%) throughout follow-up. However, severe disease was a relatively rare event, occurring in <1% of study participants who received four doses or three doses only. Conclusions: A fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to have provided additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe covid-19 disease relative to three vaccine doses. However, relative effectiveness of the fourth dose against infection appears to wane sooner than that of the third dose.},

abstract = {The worldwide shortage of vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection while the pandemic still remains uncontrolled has led many countries to the dilemma of whether or not to vaccinate previously infected persons. Understanding the level of protection conferred by previous infection compared with that of vaccination is important for policy-making. We analyzed an updated individual-level database of the entire population of Israel to assess the protection provided by both prior infection and vaccination in preventing subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe disease, and death due to COVID-19. Outcome data were collected from December 20, 2020, to March 20, 2021. Vaccination was highly protective, with overall estimated effectiveness of 94.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 94.3, 94.7) for documented infection, 95.8% (95% CI: 95.2, 96.2) for hospitalization, 96.3% (95% CI: 95.7, 96.9) for severe illness, and 96.0% (95% CI: 94.9, 96.9) for death. Similarly, the overall estimated level of protection provided by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.8% (95% CI: 94.4, 95.1) for documented infection, 94.1% (95% CI: 91.9, 95.7) for hospitalization, and 96.4% (95% CI: 92.5, 98.3) for severe illness. Our results should be considered by policy-makers when deciding whether or not to prioritize vaccination of previously infected adults.},

abstract = {Background: Although paediatric clinical presentations of COVID-19 are usually less severe than in adults, serious illness and death have occurred. Many countries started the vaccination rollout of children in 2021; still, information about effectiveness in the real-world setting is scarce. The aim of our study was to evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated-hospitalisations in the 3–17-year population during the Omicron outbreak. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including individuals aged 3–17 registered in the online vaccination system of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were administered to 12–17-year subjects; and BBIBP-CorV to 3–11-year subjects. Vaccinated group had received a two-dose scheme by 12/1/2021. Unvaccinated group did not receive any COVID-19 vaccine between 12/14/2021 and 3/9/2022, which was the entire monitoring period. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated hospitalisations was calculated as (1-OR)x100. Findings: By 12/1/2021, 1,536,435 individuals aged 3–17 who had received zero or two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were included in this study. Of the latter, 1,440,389 were vaccinated and 96,046 not vaccinated. VE were 78.0%[68.7–84.2], 76.4%[62.9–84.5] and 80.0%[64.3–88.0] for the entire cohort, 3–11-year (BBIBP-CorV) subgroup and 12–17 (mRNA vaccines) subgroup, respectively. VE for the entire population was 82.7% during the period of Delta and Omicron overlapping circulation and decreased to 67.7% when Omicron was the only variant present. Interpretation: This report provides evidence of high vaccine protection against associated hospitalisations in the paediatric population during the Omicron outbreak but suggests a decrease of protection when Omicron became predominant. Application of a booster dose in children aged 3–11-year warrants further consideration. Funding: None.},

This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness in 2 age groups (12 to 59 and 60 years or above) of 2 or 3 vaccine doses (BNT162b2 mRNA or mRNA-1273) by time since vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization in an Alpha-, Delta-, or Omicron-dominated period. Methods and findings A Danish nationwide cohort study design was used to estimate VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization with the Alpha, Delta, or Omicron variant. Information was obtained from nationwide registries and linked using a unique personal identification number. The study included all previously uninfected residents in Denmark aged 12 years or above (18 years or above for the analysis of 3 doses) in the Alpha (February 20 to June 15, 2021), Delta (July 4 to November 20, 2021), and Omicron (December 21, 2021 to January 31, 2022) dominated periods. VE estimates including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated (1-hazard ratio.100) using Cox proportional hazard regression models with underlying calendar time and adjustments for age, sex, comorbidity, and geographical region. Vaccination status was included as a time-varying exposure. In the oldest age group, VE against infection after 2 doses was 90.7% (95% CI: 88.2; 92.7) for the Alpha variant, 82.3% (95% CI: 75.5; 87.2) for the Delta variant, and 39.9% (95% CI: 26.3; 50.9) for the Omicron variant 14 to 30 days since vaccination. The VE waned over time and was 73.2% (Alpha, 95% CI: 57.1; 83.3), 50.0% (Delta, 95% CI: 46.7; 53.0), and 4.4% (Omicron, 95% CI: -0.1; 8.7) >120 days since vaccination. Higher estimates were observed after the third dose with VE estimates against infection of 86.1% (Delta, 95% CI: 83.3; 88.4) and 57.7% (Omicron, 95% CI: 55.9; 59.5) 14 to 30 days since vaccination. Among both age groups, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization 14 to 30 days since vaccination with 2 or 3 doses was 98.1% or above for the Alpha and Delta variants. Among both age groups, VE against COVID-19 hospitalization 14 to 30 days since vaccination with 2 or 3 doses was 95.5% or above for the Omicron variant. The main limitation of this study is the nonrandomized study design including potential differences between the unvaccinated (reference group) and vaccinated individuals. Conclusions Two vaccine doses provided high protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization with the Alpha and Delta variants with protection, notably against infection, waning over time. Two vaccine doses provided only limited and short-lived protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection with Omicron. However, the protection against COVID-19 hospitalization following Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher. The third vaccine dose substantially increased the level and duration of protection against infection with the Omicron variant and provided a high level of sustained protection against COVID-19 hospitalization among the year-olds.},

abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the marginal effectiveness of a fourth versus third dose and the vaccine effectiveness of mRNA covid-19 vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 against any infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes (hospital admission or death) related to the omicron variant. Design: Test negative design. Setting: Long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada, 30 December 2021 to 27 April 2022. Participants: After exclusions, 61 344 residents aged 60 years or older across 626 long term care facilities in Ontario, Canada who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Main outcome measures: Laboratory confirmed omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection (any and symptomatic) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and hospital admission or death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate marginal effectiveness (four versus three doses) and vaccine effectiveness (two, three, or four doses versus no doses) while adjusting for personal characteristics, comorbidities, week of test, and previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result more than 90 days previously. Results: 13 654 residents who tested positive for omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection and 205 862 test negative controls were included. The marginal effectiveness of a fourth dose (95% of vaccine recipients received mRNA-1273 as the fourth dose) seven days or more after vaccination versus a third dose received 84 or more days previously was 19% (95% confidence interval 12% to 26%) against infection, 31% (20% to 41%) against symptomatic infection, and 40% (24% to 52%) against severe outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness in vaccine recipients (compared with unvaccinated) increased with each additional dose, and for a fourth dose was 49% (95% confidence interval 43% to 54%) against infection, 69% (61% to 76%) against symptomatic infection, and 86% (81% to 90%) against severe outcomes. Conclusions: The findings suggest that compared with a third dose of mRNA covid-19 vaccine, a fourth dose improved protection against infection, symptomatic infection, and severe outcomes among long term care residents during an omicron dominant period. A fourth vaccine dose was associated with strong protection against severe outcomes in vaccinated residents compared with unvaccinated residents, although the duration of protection remains unknown.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The duration and effectiveness of immunity from infection with and vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are relevant to pandemic policy interventions, including the timing of vaccine boosters. METHODS We investigated the duration and effectiveness of immunity in a prospective cohort of asymptomatic health care workers in the United Kingdom who underwent routine polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing. Vaccine effectiveness (≤10 months after the first dose of vaccine) and infection-acquired immunity were assessed by comparing the time to PCR-confirmed infection in vaccinated persons with that in unvaccinated persons, stratified according to previous infection status. We used a Cox regression model with adjustment for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, vaccine type and dosing interval, demographic characteristics, and workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Of 35,768 participants, 27% (9488) had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine coverage was high: 97% of the participants had received two doses (78% had received BNT162b2 vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech] with a long interval between doses, 9% BNT162b2 vaccine with a short interval between doses, and 8% ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [AstraZeneca]). Between December 7, 2020, and September 21, 2021, a total of 2747 primary infections and 210 reinfections were observed. Among previously uninfected participants who received long-interval BNT162b2 vaccine, adjusted vaccine effectiveness decreased from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 72 to 92) 14 to 73 days after the second dose to 51% (95% CI, 22 to 69) at a median of 201 days (interquartile range, 197 to 205) after the second dose; this effectiveness did not differ significantly between the long-interval and short-interval BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. At 14 to 73 days after the second dose, adjusted vaccine effectiveness among ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients was 58% (95% CI, 23 to 77) - considerably lower than that among BNT162b2 vaccine recipients. Infection-acquired immunity waned after 1 year in unvaccinated participants but remained consistently higher than 90% in those who were subsequently vaccinated, even in persons infected more than 18 months previously. CONCLUSIONS Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were associated with high short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection; this protection waned considerably after 6 months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remained high more than 1 year after infection. (Funded by the U.K. Health Security Agency and others; ISRCTN Registry number, ISRCTN11041050.).},

abstract = {Background: The degree to which infection with SARS-CoV-2 confers protection towards subsequent reinfection is not well described. In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10{\textperiodcentered}6 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 – RR. Findings: During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2{\textperiodcentered}20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2{\textperiodcentered}11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0{\textperiodcentered}65% [95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}51–0{\textperiodcentered}82]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3{\textperiodcentered}27% [3{\textperiodcentered}22–3{\textperiodcentered}32]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0{\textperiodcentered}195 [95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}155–0{\textperiodcentered}246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80{\textperiodcentered}5% (95% CI 75{\textperiodcentered}4–84{\textperiodcentered}5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0{\textperiodcentered}212 [0{\textperiodcentered}179–0{\textperiodcentered}251], estimated protection 78{\textperiodcentered}8% [74{\textperiodcentered}9–82{\textperiodcentered}1]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47{\textperiodcentered}1% (95% CI 24{\textperiodcentered}7–62{\textperiodcentered}8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78{\textperiodcentered}4% [72{\textperiodcentered}1–83{\textperiodcentered}2] vs female 79{\textperiodcentered}1% [73{\textperiodcentered}9–83{\textperiodcentered}3]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3–6 months of follow-up 79{\textperiodcentered}3% [74{\textperiodcentered}4–83{\textperiodcentered}3] vs ≥7 months of follow-up 77{\textperiodcentered}7% [70{\textperiodcentered}9–82{\textperiodcentered}9]). Interpretation: Our findings could inform decisions on which groups should be vaccinated and advocate for vaccination of previously infected individuals because natural protection, especially among older people, cannot be relied on.

abstract = {Studies reporting vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 outcomes concentrate mainly on estimates of one single type of vaccine and variant, seldom considering waning effects. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the overall COVID-19 vaccination programme implemented in the Apulia region of Italy at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19-related hospital admissions and deaths during alpha and delta variant dominant periods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records of persons 16 years and older resident in the Apulia region, assessing the effectiveness of the combined use of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against confirmed COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths, for fully and partially vaccinated persons as well as by time since vaccination and variants. Cox regression models yielding hazard ratios were used to calculate the overall vaccination programme effectiveness. From 1 January to 1 December 2021, we included 3,530,967 eligible persons in the cohort, of whom 2,770,299 were fully vaccinated and 158,313 were COVID-19 positive at the end of the study period. The effectiveness of the programme over the entire study period for fully vaccinated persons against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and death were 87.69% (CI95% 87.73–88.18), 94.08% (93.58–94.54) and 95.95% (CI95% 95.26–96.54), respectively. The effectiveness against COVID-19 infection of fully vaccinated subjects during the alpha and delta period was respectively 88.20% (CI95% 87.60–99.78) and 59.31% (CI95% 57.91–60.67), against hospitalisation 93.89% (CI95% 92.67–94.90) and 88.32% (CI95% 86.50–89.90) and against death 93.83% (CI95% 91.65–95.45) and 85.91 (CI95% 79.98–90.09). The waning effects of the programme regarding COVID-19 infection during the delta period were stronger than for alpha, with 75.85% (CI95% 74.38–77.24) effectiveness after 1–2 months and 8.35% (CI95% 3.45–13.01) after 5–6 months after full vaccination. The effectiveness against hospitalisation and death during the delta period waned rapidly and at 7–8-months after the full vaccination respectively decreased to 27.67% (CI95% 7.48–43.45) and 48.47 (CI95% 53.97–34.82). Our study suggests that the COVID-19 vaccination program in Apulia was strongly protective against COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death due to alpha as well as delta variants, although its effectiveness is reduced over time.},

abstract = {Objective: To estimate waning of covid-19 vaccine effectiveness over six months after second dose. Design: Cohort study, approved by NHS England. Setting: Linked primary care, hospital, and covid-19 records within the OpenSAFELY-TPP database. Participants: Adults without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible, excluding care home residents and healthcare professionals. Exposures: People who had received two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 (administered during the national vaccine rollout) were compared with unvaccinated people during six consecutive comparison periods, each of four weeks. Main outcome measures: Adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and non-covid-19 related death comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated people. Waning vaccine effectiveness was quantified as ratios of adjusted hazard ratios per four week period, separately for subgroups aged ≥65 years, 18-64 years and clinically vulnerable, 40-64 years, and 18-39 years. Results: 1 951 866 and 3 219 349 eligible adults received two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, respectively, and 2 422 980 remained unvaccinated. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be similar across outcomes and vaccine brands. In the ≥65 years subgroup, ratios of adjusted hazard ratios for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test ranged from 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.24)to 1.34 (1.09 to 1.64) per four weeks. Despite waning vaccine effectiveness, rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death were substantially lower among vaccinated than unvaccinated adults up to 26 weeks after the second dose, with estimated vaccine effectiveness ≥80% for BNT162b2, and ≥75% for ChAdOx1. By weeks 23-26, rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test in vaccinated people were similar to or higher than in unvaccinated people (adjusted hazard ratios up to 1.72 (1.11 to 2.68) for BNT162b2 and 1.86 (1.79 to 1.93) for ChAdOx1). Conclusions: The rate at which estimated vaccine effectiveness waned was consistent for covid-19 related hospital admission, covid-19 related death, and positive SARS-CoV-2 test and was similar across subgroups defined by age and clinical vulnerability. If sustained to outcomes of infection with the omicron variant and to booster vaccination, these findings will facilitate scheduling of booster vaccination.},

abstract = {The duration of protection of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been evaluated in previous studies, but uncertainty remains about the persistence of effectiveness over time and the ideal timing for booster doses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers (HCWs) at a tertiary hospital depending on time elapsed since the completion of a two-dose vaccination regimen. We conducted a case–control with negative test study between 25 January and 12 December 2021 that included 1404 HCWs who underwent an active infection diagnostic test (AIDT) to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection due to COVID-19 suspicion or prior close contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection 12 to 120 days after completing the full two-dose vaccination regimen was 91.9%. Then, aVE decreased to 63.7% between 121 to 240 days after completing the full two-dose regimen and to 37.2% after 241 days since the second dose. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs remains highly effective after 12 to 120 days have elapsed since the administration of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine; however, effectiveness decreases as time elapses since its administration.},

abstract = {Background: Information on vaccine effectiveness in a context of novel variants of concern (VOC) emergence is of key importance to inform public health policies. This study aimed to estimate a measure of comparative vaccine effectiveness between Omicron (BA.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2 and sub-lineages) VOC according to vaccination exposure (primary or booster). Methods: We developed a case–case study using data on RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-positive cases notified in Portugal during Weeks 49–51, 2021. To obtain measure of comparative vaccine effectiveness, we compared the odds of vaccination in Omicron cases versus Delta using logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, region, week of diagnosis, and laboratory of origin. Results: Higher odds of vaccination were observed in cases infected by Omicron VOC compared with Delta VOC cases for both complete primary vaccination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 2.4) and booster dose (OR = 5.2; 95% CI: 3.1 to 8.8), equivalent to reduction of vaccine effectiveness from 44.7% and 92.8%, observed against infection with Delta, to −6.0% (95% CI: 29.2% to 12.7%) and 62.7% (95% CI: 35.7% to 77.9%), observed against infection with Omicron, for complete primary vaccination and booster dose, respectively. Conclusion: Consistent reduction in vaccine-induced protection against infection with Omicron was observed. Complete primary vaccination may not be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in regions where Omicron variant is dominant.},

abstract = {Objectives To characterize the clinical severity of covid-19 associated with the alpha, delta, and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants among adults admitted to hospital and to compare the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines to prevent hospital admissions related to each variant. Design Case-control study. Setting 21 hospitals across the United States. Participants 11 690 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: Alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). Main outcome measures Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization's clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. Results Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The duration of protection afforded by coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines in the United States is unclear. Whether the increase in postvaccination infections during the summer of 2021 was caused by declining immunity over time, the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, or both is unknown. METHODS We extracted data regarding Covid-19-related vaccination and outcomes during a 9-month period (December 11, 2020, to September 8, 2021) for approximately 10.6 million North Carolina residents by linking data from the North Carolina Covid-19 Surveillance System and the Covid-19 Vaccine Management System. We used a Cox regression model to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson-Janssen) vaccines in reducing the current risks of Covid-19, hospitalization, and death, as a function of time elapsed since vaccination. RESULTS For the two-dose regimens of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (30 $\mu$g per dose) and mRNA-1273 (100 $\mu$g per dose), vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.1 to 94.9) and 95.9% (95% CI, 95.5 to 96.2), respectively, at 2 months after the first dose and decreased to 66.6% (95% CI, 65.2 to 67.8) and 80.3% (95% CI, 79.3 to 81.2), respectively, at 7 months. Among early recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, effectiveness decreased by approximately 15 and 10 percentage points, respectively, from mid-June to mid-July, when the delta variant became dominant. For the one-dose regimen of Ad26.COV2.S (5 × 1010 viral particles), effectiveness against Covid-19 was 74.8% (95% CI, 72.5 to 76.9) at 1 month and decreased to 59.4% (95% CI, 57.2 to 61.5) at 5 months. All three vaccines maintained better effectiveness in preventing hospitalization and death than in preventing infection over time, although the two mRNA vaccines provided higher levels of protection than Ad26.COV2.S. CONCLUSIONS All three Covid-19 vaccines had durable effectiveness in reducing the risks of hospitalization and death. Waning protection against infection over time was due to both declining immunity and the emergence of the delta variant.

abstract = {Importance: The benefit of primary and booster vaccination in people who experienced prior SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Objective: To estimate the effectiveness of a primary (two-dose) and booster (third dose) vaccination against Omicron infection among previously infection people. Design: Test-negative case-control study. Setting: Yale New Haven Health System facilities serving southern Connecticut communities. Participants: Vaccine eligible people who received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between November 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. Exposure: COVID-19 mRNA primary and booster vaccination. Main Outcomes and Measures: We conducted two analyses, each with an outcome of Omicron BA.1 variant infection (S-gene target failure defined) and each stratified by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status. We estimated the effectiveness of primary vaccination during the period before and during booster eligibility (14-149 and ≥150 days, respectively, after 2nd dose) and of booster vaccination (≥14 days after booster dose). To test whether booster vaccination reduced the risk of infection beyond that of the primary series, we compared the odds among boosted and booster eligible people. Results: Overall, 10,676 cases and 119,397 controls were included (median age: cases: 35 years, controls: 39 years). Among cases and controls, 6.1% and 7.8% had a prior infection. The effectiveness of primary vaccination 14-149 days after 2nd dose was 36.1% (95% CI, 7.1-56.1%) and 28.5% (95% CI, 20.0-36.2%) for people with and without prior infection, respectively. The effectiveness of booster vaccination was 45.8% (95% CI, 20.0-63.2%) and 56.9% (95% CI, 52.1-61.2%) in people with and without prior infection, respectively. The odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people with prior infection was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.56-1.23), whereas the odds ratio comparing boosted and booster eligible people without prior infection was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.46-0.56). Conclusions and Relevance: Primary vaccination provided significant but limited protection against Omicron BA.1 infection among people with and without prior infection. While booster vaccination was associated with additional protection in people without prior infection, it was not associated with additional protection among people with prior infection. These findings support primary vaccination in people regardless of prior infection status but suggest that infection history should be considered when evaluating the need for booster vaccination.Competing Interest StatementA.I.K serves as an expert panel member for Reckitt Global Hygiene Institute, scientific advisory board member for Revelar Biotherapeutics and a consultant for Tata Medical and Diagnostics and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and has received grants from Merck, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Tata Medical and Diagnostics for research related to COVID-19.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), has contributed to a surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the United Kingdom. The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS We used a test-negative case-control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients' vaccination status. RESULTS Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant. CONCLUSIONS Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded by Public Health England.).},

abstract = {As national coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mass vaccination campaigns are rolled out, monitoring real-world Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) and its durability is essential. We aimed to estimate COVID-19 VE against severe disease and death in the Greek population, for all vaccines currently in use. Nationwide active surveillance and vaccination registry data during January–December 2021 were used to estimate VE via quasi-Poisson regression, adjusted for age and calendar time. Interaction terms were included to assess VE by age group, against the “delta” severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant and waning of VE over time. Two doses of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, or ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccines offered very high (>90%) VE against both intubation and death across all age groups, similar against both “delta” and previous variants, with one-dose Ad26.COV2.S slightly lower. VE waned over time but remained >80% at 6 months, and three doses increased VE again to near 100%. Vaccination prevented an estimated 19 691 COVID-19 deaths (95% confidence interval: 18 890–20 788) over the study period. All approved vaccines offer strong and also durable protection against COVID-19 severe disease and death. Every effort should be made to vaccinate the population with at least two doses, to reduce the mortality and morbidity impact of the pandemic.},

abstract = {Background Using data from electronic health registries, this study intended to estimate the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the population aged 65 years and more, against symptomatic infection, COVID-19-related hospitalizations, and deaths, overall and by time since complete vaccination for the period February to September 2021 Methods We established a cohort of individuals aged 65 and more years old, resident in Portugal mainland, using the National Health Service User number to link eight electronic health registries. Outcomes included were symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths. The exposures of interest were the mRNA vaccines (Comirnaty or Spikevax) and the viral vector (Vaxzevria) vaccine. Complete schedule VE was estimated as one minus the confounder adjusted hazard ratio, for each outcome, estimated by time-dependent Cox regression with time-dependent vaccine exposure. Results For the cohort of individuals aged 65–79 years, complete scheme VE against symptomatic infection varied 43 (95%CI: 37–49) (Vaxzevria) and 65 (95%CI: 62–68) (mRNA vaccines). This estimate was slightly lower in the ≥80 years cohort (53, 95%CI: 45–60) for mRNA vaccines). VE against COVID-19 hospitalization varied between 89% (95%CI: 52–94) for Vaxzevria and 95% (95%CI: 93–97) for mRNA vaccines for the cohort aged 65–79 years and was 76% (95%CI: 67–83) for mRNA vaccines in the ≥80 years cohort. High VE against COVID-19-related deaths was estimated, for both vaccine types, 95% and 81 (95%CI:76–86) for the 65–79 years and the ≥80 years cohort, respectively. We observed a significant waning of VE against symptomatic infection, with VE estimates reaching approximately 34% for both vaccine types and cohorts. Significant waning was observed for the COVID-19 hospitalizations in the ≥80 years cohort (decay from 83% (95%CI:68 to 91) 14–41 days to 63% (95%CI:37 to 78) 124 days after mRNA second dose). No significant waning effect was observed for COVID-19-related deaths in the period of follow-up of either cohort. Conclusions In a population with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, we observed higher overall VE estimates against more severe outcomes for both age cohorts when compared to symptomatic infections. Considering the analysis of VE according to time since complete vaccination, the results showed a waning effect for both age cohorts in symptomatic infection and COVID-19 hospitalization for the 80 and more years cohort.},

abstract = {Background: Although high vaccine effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has been reported in studies in several countries, data are limited from Asian countries, especially against the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Methods: We conducted a multicenter test-negative case-control study in patients aged ≥16 years visiting hospitals or clinics with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 from 1 July to 30 September 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant (≥90% of SARS-CoV-2 infections) nationwide in Japan. Vaccine effectiveness of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was evaluated. Waning immunity among patients aged 16-64 years was also assessed. Results: We enrolled 1936 patients, including 396 test-positive cases and 1540 test-negative controls for SARS-CoV-2. The median age was 49 years, 53.4% were male, and 34.0% had underlying medical conditions. Full vaccination (receiving 2 doses ≥14 days before symptom onset) was received by 6.6% of cases and 38.8% of controls. Vaccine effectiveness of full vaccination against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 88.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.8%-93.9%) among patients aged 16-64 years and 90.3% (95% CI, 73.6%-96.4%) among patients aged ≥65 years. Among patients aged 16-64 years, vaccine effectiveness was 91.8% (95% CI, 80.3%-96.6%) within 1-3 months after full vaccination, and 86.4% (95% CI, 56.9%-95.7%) within 4-6 months. Conclusions: mRNA COVID-19 vaccines had high effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Japan during July-September 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant nationwide.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND With large waves of infection driven by the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), alongside evidence of waning immunity after the booster dose of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, several countries have begun giving at-risk persons a fourth vaccine dose. METHODS To evaluate the early effectiveness of a fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19-related outcomes, we analyzed data recorded by the largest health care organization in Israel from January 3 to February 18, 2022. We evaluated the relative effectiveness of a fourth vaccine dose as compared with that of a third dose given at least 4 months earlier among persons 60 years of age or older. We compared outcomes in persons who had received a fourth dose with those in persons who had not, individually matching persons from these two groups with respect to multiple sociodemographic and clinical variables. A sensitivity analysis was performed with the use of parametric Poisson regression. RESULTS The primary analysis included 182,122 matched pairs. Relative vaccine effectiveness in days 7 to 30 after the fourth dose was estimated to be 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 47) against polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 55% (95% CI, 53 to 58) against symptomatic Covid-19, 68% (95% CI, 59 to 74) against Covid-19-related hospitalization, 62% (95% CI, 50 to 74) against severe Covid-19, and 74% (95% CI, 50 to 90) against Covid-19-related death. The corresponding estimates in days 14 to 30 after the fourth dose were 52% (95% CI, 49 to 54), 61% (95% CI, 58 to 64), 72% (95% CI, 63 to 79), 64% (95% CI, 48 to 77), and 76% (95% CI, 48 to 91). In days 7 to 30 after a fourth vaccine dose, the difference in the absolute risk (three doses vs. four doses) was 180.1 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 142.8 to 211.9) for Covid-19-related hospitalization and 68.8 cases per 100,000 persons (95% CI, 48.5 to 91.9) for severe Covid-19. In sensitivity analyses, estimates of relative effectiveness against documented infection were similar to those in the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS A fourth dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was effective in reducing the short-term risk of Covid-19-related outcomes among persons who had received a third dose at least 4 months earlier.

abstract = {Background: Comparative effectiveness of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines across patient subgroups is poorly understood and essential to precisely targeting vaccination strategies. Methods: We used the US Department of Veterans Affairs COVID-19 Shared Data Resource to identify veterans who utilize VA health care and had no documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before December 11, 2020. Using a test-negative case-control design (TND), we used conditional logistic regression with adjustment for covariates to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time for veterans who received 2 doses of mRNA vaccines or 1 dose of Ad26.Cov2.S. Results: We identified 4.8 million veterans with a mean age of 64 years, of whom 58% had ≥1 chronic disease. Vaccine effectiveness for symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and ICU admission or death declined over time and varied by the type of vaccine (P < 0.01). VE estimates against symptomatic infection during months 1 and 7 for mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 were 89.7% (95% CI, 84.4%-93.0%) and 57.3% (95% CI, 48.4%-64.7%) vs 81.6% (95% CI, 75.9%-85.9%) and 22.5% (95% CI, 7.2%-35.2%) for individuals age <65 years and 78.4% (95% CI, 71.1%-83.9%) and 36.2% (95% CI, 27.7%-43.6%) vs 66.3% (95% CI, 55.7%-74.4%) and -23.3% (95% CI, -40.5% to -8.2%) in subjects age ≥65 years; against hospitalization 92.0% (95% CI, 76.1%-97.3%) and 83.1% (95% CI, 66.8%-91.4%) vs 85.6% (95% CI, 72.6%-92.4%) and 57.0% (95% CI, 31.2%-73.2%) in subjects age <65 years and 66.1% (95% CI, 45.3%-79.0%) and 64.7% (95% CI, 55.2%-72.3%) vs 61.0% (95% CI, 41.3%-74.2%) and 1.7% (95% CI, -22.0% to 20.8%) in those age ≥65 years; against ICU admission or death 89.2% (95% CI, 49.5%-97.7%) and 84.4% (95% CI, 59.0%-94.1%) vs 87.6% (95% CI, 61.0%-96.1%) and 66.4% (95% CI, 7.7%-87.8%) in subjects age <65 years and 75.4% (95% CI, 51.7%-87.5%) and 73.8 (95% CI, 62.9%-81.5%) vs 67.4% (95% CI, 32.6%-84.3%) and 29.3% (95% CI, 2.3%-48.9%) in subjects age ≥65 years, respectively (Pinteraction <. 01 for all comparisons). Similarly, mRNA-1273 was more effective than BNT162b2 in veterans with >1 chronic disease. Conclusions: mRNA-1273 was more effective than BNT162b2 in older veterans and those with chronic diseases.},

abstract = {Background: With the surge of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, countries have begun offering COVID-19 vaccine booster doses to high-risk groups and, more recently, to the adult population in general. However, uncertainty remains over how long primary vaccination series remain effective, the ideal timing for booster doses, and the safety of heterologous booster regimens. We aimed to investigate COVID-19 primary vaccine series effectiveness and its waning, and the safety and effectiveness of booster doses, in a UK community setting. Methods: We used SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates in individuals from a longitudinal, prospective, community-based study (ZOE COVID Study), in which data were self-reported through an app, to assess the effectiveness of three COVID-19 vaccines (ChAdOx1 nCov19 [Oxford-AstraZeneca], BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNtech], and mRNA1273 [Moderna]) against infection in the 8 months after completion of primary vaccination series. In individuals receiving boosters, we investigated vaccine effectiveness and reactogenicity, by assessing 16 self-reported systemic and localised side-effects. We used multivariate Poisson regression models adjusting for confounders to estimate vaccine effectiveness. Findings: We included 620 793 participants who received two vaccine doses (204 731 [33{\textperiodcentered}0%] received BNT162b2, 405 239 [65{\textperiodcentered}3%] received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and 10 823 [1{\textperiodcentered}7%] received mRNA-1273) and subsequently had a SARS-CoV-2 test result between May 23 (chosen to exclude the period of alpha [B.1.1.7] variant dominance) and Nov 23, 2021. 62 172 (10{\textperiodcentered}0%) vaccinated individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were compared with 40 345 unvaccinated controls (6726 [16{\textperiodcentered}7%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness waned after the second dose: at 5 months, BNT162b2 effectiveness was 82{\textperiodcentered}1% (95% CI 81{\textperiodcentered}3–82{\textperiodcentered}9), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 effectiveness was 75{\textperiodcentered}7% (74{\textperiodcentered}9–76{\textperiodcentered}4), and mRNA-1273 effectiveness was 84{\textperiodcentered}3% (81{\textperiodcentered}2–86{\textperiodcentered}9). Vaccine effectiveness decreased more among individuals aged 55 years or older and among those with comorbidities. 135 932 individuals aged 55 years or older received a booster (2123 [1{\textperiodcentered}6%] of whom tested positive). Vaccine effectiveness for booster doses in 0–3 months after BNT162b2 primary vaccination was higher than 92{\textperiodcentered}5%, and effectiveness for heterologous boosters after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was at least 88{\textperiodcentered}8%. For the booster reactogenicity analysis, in 317 011 participants, the most common systemic symptom was fatigue (in 31 881 [10{\textperiodcentered}1%] participants) and the most common local symptom was tenderness (in 187 767 [59{\textperiodcentered}2%]). Systemic side-effects were more common for heterologous schedules (32 632 [17{\textperiodcentered}9%] of 182 374) than for homologous schedules (17 707 [13{\textperiodcentered}2%] of 134 637; odds ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}5, 95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}5–1{\textperiodcentered}6, p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Interpretation: After 5 months, vaccine effectiveness remained high among individuals younger than 55 years. Booster doses restore vaccine effectiveness.

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) are more transmissible and may have the potential for increased disease severity and decreased vaccine effectiveness. We estimated the effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty), mRNA-1273 (Moderna Spikevax) and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria) vaccines against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization or death caused by the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) VOC in Ontario, Canada, using a test-negative design study. We identified 682,071 symptomatic community-dwelling individuals who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 15,269 individuals with a COVID-19 hospitalization or death. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection ≥7 d after two doses was 89–92% against Alpha, 87% against Beta, 88% against Gamma, 82–89% against Beta/Gamma and 87–95% against Delta across vaccine products. The corresponding estimates ≥14 d after one dose were lower. Effectiveness estimates against hospitalization or death were similar to or higher than against symptomatic infection. Effectiveness against symptomatic infection was generally lower for older adults (≥60 years) than for younger adults (<60 years) for most of the VOC–vaccine combinations. Our findings suggest that jurisdictions facing vaccine supply constraints may benefit from delaying the second dose in younger individuals to more rapidly achieve greater overall population protection; however, older adults would likely benefit most from minimizing the delay in receiving the second dose to achieve adequate protection against VOC.},

abstract = {Background: A major goal of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination is to prevent severe outcomes (hospitalizations and deaths). We estimated the effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against severe outcomes in 4 Canadian provinces between December 2020 and September 2021. Methods: We conducted this multiprovincial, retrospective, test-negative study among community-dwelling adults aged ≥18 years in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Manitoba using linked provincial databases and a common study protocol. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate province-specific vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 hospitalization and/or death. Estimates were pooled using random-effects models. Results: We included 2 508 296 tested participants, with 31 776 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 5842 deaths. Vaccine effectiveness was 83% after a first dose and 98% after a second dose against both hospitalization and death (separately). Against severe outcomes, effectiveness was 87% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71%-94%) ≥84 days after a first dose of mRNA vaccine, increasing to 98% (95% CI, 96%-99%) ≥112 days after a second dose. Vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes for ChAdOx1 was 88% (95% CI, 75%-94%) ≥56 days after a first dose, increasing to 97% (95% CI, 91%-99%) ≥56 days after a second dose. Lower 1-dose effectiveness was observed for adults aged ≥80 years and those with comorbidities, but effectiveness became comparable after a second dose. Two doses of vaccines provided very high protection for both homologous and heterologous schedules and against Alpha, Gamma, and Delta variants. Conclusions: Two doses of mRNA or ChAdOx1 vaccine provide excellent protection against severe outcomes.},

abstract = {Background Real-world: evidence on the safety and effectiveness of Coronavirus : Disease 2019 (COVIDAU -: Pleas 19) vaccination against severe disease caused by the omicron variant among adolescents is sparse. In addition, evidence on risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease, and whether vaccination is similarly effective in such risk groups, is unclear. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the safety and effectiveness of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination against COVID-19 hospitalisation, and risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation in adolescents. Methods and findings A cohort study was conducted using Swedish nationwide registers. The safety analysis included all individuals in Sweden born between 2003 and 2009 (aged 11.3 to 19.2 years) given at least 1 dose of monovalent mRNA vaccine (N = 645,355), and never vaccinated controls (N = 186,918). The outcomes included all-cause hospitalisation and 30 selected diagnoses until 5 June 2022. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 hospitalisation, and risk factors for hospitalisation, were evaluated in adolescents given 2 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine (N = 501,945), as compared to never vaccinated controls (N = 157,979), for up to 5 months follow-up during an omicron predominant period (1 January 2022 to 5 June 2022). Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline date, and whether the individual was born in Sweden. The safety analysis showed that vaccination was associated with 16% lower (95% confidence interval (CI) [12, 19], p < 0.001) risk of all-cause hospitalisation, and with marginal differences between the groups regarding the 30 selected diagnoses. In the VE analysis, there were 21 cases (0.004%) of COVID-19 hospitalisation among 2-dose recipients and 26 cases (0.016%) among controls, resulting in a VE of 76% (95% CI [57, 87], p < 0.001). Predominant risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation included previous infections (bacterial infection, tonsillitis, and pneumonia) (odds ratio [OR]: 14.3, 95% CI [7.7, 26.6], p < 0.001), and cerebral palsy/development disorders (OR: 12.7, 95% CI [6.8, 23.8], p < 0.001), with similar estimates of VE in these subgroups as in the total cohort. The number needed to vaccinate with 2 doses to prevent 1 case of COVID-19 hospitalisation was 8,147 in the total cohort and 1,007 in those with previous infections or developmental disorders. None of the individuals hospitalised due to COVID-19 died within 30 days. Limitations of this study include the observational design and the possibility of unmeasured confounding. Conclusions In this nationwide study of Swedish adolescents, monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of any serious adverse events resulting in hospitailedforthoseusedthroughoutthetext lisation. Vaccination with:Pleaseverifythatallentriesarecorrect 2 doses was associated with : a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation during an omicron predominant period, also among those with certain predisposing conditions who should be prioritised for vaccination. However, COVID-19 hospitalisation in the general population of adolescents was extremely rare, and additional doses in this population may not be warranted at this stage.},

abstract = {Background: The omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated partial vaccine escape and high transmissibility, with early studies indicating lower severity of infection than that of the delta variant (B.1.617.2). We aimed to better characterise omicron severity relative to delta by assessing the relative risk of hospital attendance, hospital admission, or death in a large national cohort. Methods: Individual-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases resident in England between Nov 29, 2021, and Jan 9, 2022, were linked to routine datasets on vaccination status, hospital attendance and admission, and mortality. The relative risk of hospital attendance or admission within 14 days, or death within 28 days after confirmed infection, was estimated using proportional hazards regression. Analyses were stratified by test date, 10-year age band, ethnicity, residential region, and vaccination status, and were further adjusted for sex, index of multiple deprivation decile, evidence of a previous infection, and year of age within each age band. A secondary analysis estimated variant-specific and vaccine-specific vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic relative severity of omicron infection compared with delta (ie, the relative risk in unvaccinated cases). Findings: The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospital attendance (not necessarily resulting in admission) with omicron compared with delta was 0{\textperiodcentered}56 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}54–0{\textperiodcentered}58); for hospital admission and death, HR estimates were 0{\textperiodcentered}41 (0{\textperiodcentered}39–0{\textperiodcentered}43) and 0{\textperiodcentered}31 (0{\textperiodcentered}26–0{\textperiodcentered}37), respectively. Omicron versus delta HR estimates varied with age for all endpoints examined. The adjusted HR for hospital admission was 1{\textperiodcentered}10 (0{\textperiodcentered}85–1{\textperiodcentered}42) in those younger than 10 years, decreasing to 0{\textperiodcentered}25 (0{\textperiodcentered}21–0{\textperiodcentered}30) in 60–69-year-olds, and then increasing to 0{\textperiodcentered}47 (0{\textperiodcentered}40–0{\textperiodcentered}56) in those aged at least 80 years. For both variants, past infection gave some protection against death both in vaccinated (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}47 [0{\textperiodcentered}32–0{\textperiodcentered}68]) and unvaccinated (0{\textperiodcentered}18 [0{\textperiodcentered}06–0{\textperiodcentered}57]) cases. In vaccinated cases, past infection offered no additional protection against hospital admission beyond that provided by vaccination (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}96 [0{\textperiodcentered}88–1{\textperiodcentered}04]); however, for unvaccinated cases, past infection gave moderate protection (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}55 [0{\textperiodcentered}48–0{\textperiodcentered}63]). Omicron versus delta HR estimates were lower for hospital admission (0{\textperiodcentered}30 [0{\textperiodcentered}28–0{\textperiodcentered}32]) in unvaccinated cases than the corresponding HR estimated for all cases in the primary analysis. Booster vaccination with an mRNA vaccine was highly protective against hospitalisation and death in omicron cases (HR for hospital admission 8–11 weeks post-booster vs unvaccinated: 0{\textperiodcentered}22 [0{\textperiodcentered}20–0{\textperiodcentered}24]), with the protection afforded after a booster not being affected by the vaccine used for doses 1 and 2. Interpretation: The risk of severe outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially lower for omicron than for delta, with higher reductions for more severe endpoints and significant variation with age. Underlying the observed risks is a larger reduction in intrinsic severity (in unvaccinated individuals) counterbalanced by a reduction in vaccine effectiveness. Documented previous SARS-CoV-2 infection offered some protection against hospitalisation and high protection against death in unvaccinated individuals, but only offered additional protection in vaccinated individuals for the death endpoint. Booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines maintains over 70% protection against hospitalisation and death in breakthrough confirmed omicron infections.

While mRNA-1273 demonstrated high efficacy in prevention of COVID-19, including severe disease, its effect on the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections is not understood. Here, in exploratory analyses, we assessed the impact of mRNA-1273 vaccination in the ongoing COVE trial (number NCT04470427) on SARS-CoV-2 copy number and shedding, burden of disease and infection, and viral variants. Viral variants were sequenced in all COVID-19 and adjudicated COVID-19 cases (n = 832), from July 2020 in the blinded part A of the study to May 2021 of the open-label part B of the study, in which participants in the placebo arm started to receive the mRNA-1273 vaccine after US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of mRNA-1273 in December 2020. mRNA-1273 vaccination significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number (95% confidence interval) by 100-fold on the day of diagnosis compared with placebo (4.1 (3.4–4.8) versus 6.2 (6.0–6.4) log10 copies per ml). Median times to undetectable viral copies were 4 days for mRNA-1273 and 7 days for placebo. Vaccination also substantially reduced the burden of disease and infection scores. Vaccine efficacies (95% confidence interval) against SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the United States during the trial assessed in this post hoc analysis were 82.4% (40.4–94.8%) for variants Epsilon and Gamma and 81.2% (36.1–94.5%) for Epsilon. The detection of other, non-SARS-CoV-2, respiratory viruses during the trial was similar between groups. While additional study is needed, these data show that in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, vaccination reduced both the viral copy number and duration of detectable viral RNA, which may be markers for the risk of virus transmission.},

abstract = {Introduction: residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at high risk of adverse outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to estimate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of one and two doses of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx-1 against SARS CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related death in residents of LTCFs. Methods: this observational study used testing, vaccination and mortality data for LTCF residents aged ≥ 65 years who were regularly tested regardless of symptoms from 8 December 2020 to 30 September 2021 in England. Adjusted VE, calculated as one minus adjusted hazard ratio, was estimated using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models for infection and death within 28 days of positive test result. Vaccine status was defined by receipt of one or two doses of vaccine and assessed over a range of intervals. Results: of 197,885 LTCF residents, 47,087 (23.8%) had a positive test and 11,329 (5.8%) died within 28 days of a positive test during the study period. Relative to unvaccinated individuals, VE for infection was highest for ChAdOx-1 at 61% (40-74%) 7at 1-4 weeks and for BNT162b2 at 69% (52-80%) at 11-15 weeks following the second dose. Against death, VE was highest for ChAdOx-1 at 83% (58-94%) at 1-4 weeks and for BNT162b2 at 91% (75-97%) at 11-15 weeks following second dose. Conclusions: compared with unvaccinated residents, vaccination with one dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx-1 provided moderate protection against infection and death in residents of LTCFs. Protection against death improved after two doses. However, some waning of protection over time was noted.},

abstract = {Importance: With the evidence of waning immunity of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), a nationwide third-dose (booster) vaccination campaign was initiated in Israel during August 2021; other countries have begun to administer a booster shot as well. Objective: To evaluate the initial short-term additional benefit of a 3-dose vs a 2-dose regimen against infection of SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This preliminary retrospective case-control study used 2 complementary approaches: a test-negative design and a matched case-control design. Participants were included from the national centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, an Israeli healthcare maintenance organization covering 2.5 million members. Data were collected between March 1, 2020, and October 4, 2021, and analyses focused on the period from August 1, 2021, to October 4, 2021, because the booster dose was widely administered from August 1 onward. Exposures: Either 2 doses or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The reduction in the odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at different time intervals following receipt of the booster dose (0-6, 7-13, 14-20, 21-27, and 28-65 days) compared with receiving only 2 doses. Results: The study population included 306710 members of Maccabi Healthcare Services who were 40 years and older (55% female) and received either 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and did not have a positive PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to the start of the follow-up period. During this period, there were 500232 PCR tests performed, 227380 among those who received 2 doses and 272852 among those who received 3 doses, with 14989 (6.6%) and 4941 (1.8%) positive test results in each group, respectively. Comparing those who received a booster and those who received 2 doses, there was an estimated odds ratio of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.13-0.15) 28 to 65 days following receipt of the booster (86% reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2). Conclusion and Relevance: Previous studies have demonstrated that vaccine-derived protection against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time. In this case-control analysis, we showed an association between receipt of the booster dose and a reduction in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, potentially counteracting waning immunity in the short term. Further monitoring of data from this population is needed to determine the duration of immunity following the booster.},

By conducting a retrospective study implementing a test-negative case-control design, analyzing 546,924 PCR tests performed throughout January 2022 by 389,265 persons who received at least two doses, we find that the effectiveness in each month-since-vaccination decreases significantly. Compared to those vaccinated five months prior to the outcome period, on August 2021, relative protection against infection waned from 53.4% a month after vaccination to 16.5% three months after vaccination. These results suggest that there is a significant waning of vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron variant of the third dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine within a few months after administration. Additional information could assist to comprehensively estimate the effectiveness of the three-dose-strategy.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections requires continuous re-evaluation, given the increasingly dominant B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of these vaccines in a large, community-based survey of randomly selected households across the United Kingdom. We found that the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 against infections (new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cases) with symptoms or high viral burden is reduced with the B.1.617.2 variant (absolute difference of 10–13% for BNT162b2 and 16% for ChAdOx1) compared to the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant. The effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity after second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positive cases but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher in vaccinated individuals after a prior infection and in younger adults. With B.1.617.2, infections occurring after two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden as those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with B.1.617.2.},

abstract = {Background Little is known about the protection following prior infection with different SARS-CoV-2 variants, COVID-19 vaccination, and a combination of the two (hybrid immunity) in adolescents. Methods We used national SARS-CoV-2 testing and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination data in England to estimate protection following previous infection and vaccination against symptomatic PCR-confirmed delta and omicron (BA.1 or BA.2) variants in 11-17-year-olds using a test-negative case-control design. Findings By 31 March 2022, 63.6% of 16-17-year-olds and 48.2% of 12-15-year-olds had received more than one COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dose. Between 08 August 2021 and 31 March 2022, 1,161,704 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-tests were successfully linked to COVID-19 vaccination status. In unvaccinated adolescents, prior infection with wildtype, alpha or delta provided greater protection against subsequent delta infection than subsequent omicron; prior omicron infection provided had the highest protection against omicron reinfection (59.3%; 95%CI: 46.7-69.0). In infection-naive adolescents, vaccination provided lower protection against symptomatic omicron infection than delta, peaking at 64.5% (95%CI; 63.6-65.4) 2-14 days after dose two and 62.9% (95%CI; 60.5-65.1) 2-14 weeks after dose three, with rapidly waning protection after each dose. Previously infected and vaccinated adolescents had the highest protection, irrespective of primary infecting SARS-CoV-2 strain. The highest protection against omicron was observed in vaccinated adolescents with prior omicron infection, reaching 96.4% (95%CI, 84.4-99.1) at 15-24 weeks post dose two. Interpretation All variants provide some protection against symptomatic reinfection and vaccination adds to protection. Vaccination provides low-to-moderate protection against symptomatic omicron infection, with waning protection after each dose, while hybrid immunity provides the most robust protection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Surveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) testing and vaccination is undertaken under Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 to collect confidential patient information (www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1438/regulation/3/made) under Sections 3(i) (a) to (c), 3(i)(d) (i) and (ii), and 3.

Using 1,945,071 real-time PCR results from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021, we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections ≥21 d after the first dose (61% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 54–68%) versus 66% (95% CI = 60–71%), respectively), with greater reductions observed after a second dose (79% (95% CI = 65–88%) versus 80% (95% CI = 73–85%), respectively). The largest reductions were observed for symptomatic infections and/or infections with a higher viral burden. Overall, COVID-19 vaccination reduced the number of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, with the largest benefit received after two vaccinations and against symptomatic and high viral burden infections, and with no evidence of a difference between the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines.},

abstract = {Background: The short-term effectiveness of a 2-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine for adolescents has been demonstrated. However, little is known about the long-term effectiveness in this age group. It is known, however, that waning of vaccine-induced immunity against infection in adult populations is evident within a few months. Methods: Leveraging the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), we conducted a matched case-control design for evaluating the association between time since vaccination and the incidence of infections, where 2 outcomes were evaluated: documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) and symptomatic infection (COVID-19). Cases were defined as individuals aged 12-16 with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test occurring between 15 June and 8 December 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel. Controls were adolescents who had not tested positive previously. Results: We estimated a peak vaccine effectiveness between 2 weeks and 3 months following receipt of the second dose, with 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 84-86%) and 90% (95% CI: 89-91%) effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively. However, in line with findings for adults, waning effectiveness was evident. Long-term protection was reduced to 73% (95% CI: 68-77%) against infection and 79% (95% CI: 73-83%) against COVID-19 3-5 months after the second dose and waned to 53% (95% CI: 46-60%) against infection and 66% (95% CI: 59-72%) against COVID-19 after 5 months. Conclusions: Although vaccine-induced protection against both infection and COVID-19 continues over time in adolescents, the protection wanes with time since vaccination, starting 3 months after inoculation and continuing for more than 5 months.},

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections have been increasingly reported in fully vaccinated individuals. We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2, defined as 14 days after the second dose, against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a national medical practice between February 1, 2021 and August 22, 2021. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. The primary population included 652 individuals who had a positive symptomatic test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 5,946 individuals with at least one negative symptomatic test after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 120 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-7.74). Importantly, the odds of infection were still lower 150 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of experiencing a non-COVID-19 hospitalization decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in patients ≥12 years who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus from April 14 through October 25, 2021, at urgent care centers in the New York metropolitan area. Patients self-reported vaccination status at the time of testing. We used a test-negative design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) by comparing odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection among vaccinated (n = 474,805), partially vaccinated (n = 87,834), and unvaccinated (n = 369,333) patients, adjusted for demographic factors and calendar time. Results: VE against symptomatic infection after 2 doses of mRNA vaccine was 96% (95% Confidence Interval: 95%, 97%) in the pre-delta period and reduced to 79% (95% CI: 77%, 81%) in the delta period. In the delta period, VE for 12–15-year-olds (85%; [95% CI: 81%, 88%]) was higher compared to older age groups (<65% for all other age groups). VE estimates did not differ by sex and race/ethnicity. VE against symptomatic infection was the highest for individuals with a prior infection followed by full vaccination. VE against symptomatic infection after the 2-dose mRNA-1273 vaccine (82% [95% CI: 80%, 84%]) was higher compared to the BNT162b2 vaccine (76% [95% CI: 74%, 78%]) in the delta period. VE after 1-dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was the lowest compared to other vaccines (19% [95% CI: 15%, 23%]) in the delta period. Conclusions: VE against infection after two doses of the mRNA vaccines was high initially, but significantly reduced against the delta variant for both FDA-approved vaccines.},

This propensity-score matched retrospective cohort study takes place in a large public university undergoing weekly Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) testing in South Carolina, USA. The population consists of 24,145 university students and employees undergoing weekly Covid-19 testing between January 3 rd and January 31 st , 2022. The analytic sample was constructed via propensity score matching on vaccination status: unvaccinated, completion of 2-dose mRNA series (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) within the previous 5 months, and receipt of mRNA booster dose (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) within the previous 5 months. The resulting analytic sample consists of 1,944 university students (mean [SD] age, 19.64 [1.42] years, 66.4% female, 81.3% non-Hispanic White) and 658 university employees (mean [SD] age, 43.05 [12.22] years, 64.7% female, 83.3% non-Hispanic White). Booster protection against any SARS-CoV-2 infection was 66.4% among employees (95% CI: 46.1–79.0%; P < .001) and 45.4% among students (95% CI: 30.0–57.4%; P < .001). Compared to the 2-dose mRNA series, estimated increase in protection from the booster dose was 40.8% among employees ( P = .024) and 37.7% among students ( P = .001). We did not have enough evidence to conclude a statistically significant protective effect of the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series, nor did we have enough evidence to conclude that protection waned in the 5-month period after receipt of the 2 nd or 3 rd mRNA dose. Furthermore, we did not find evidence that protection varied by manufacturer. We conclude that in adults 18–65 years of age, Covid-19 mRNA booster doses offer moderate protection against general SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the omicron variant and provide a substantial increase in protection relative to the 2-dose mRNA vaccination series. },

abstract = {Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant has spread rapidly throughout the world since being identified in South Africa in November 2021. Few studies have assessed primary series and booster vaccine effectiveness against Omicron among US healthcare workers Methods: We conducted a test-negative case-control design to estimate BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 primary vaccination and booster effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 during an Omicron surge among employees of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. The study period was between 1 July 2021 and 5 April 2022. We defined the Delta period as 1 July to 12 December 2021 and the Omicron period as beginning 12 December 21. Results: Our sample included 14 520 tests (2776 [19%] positive) - 7422 (506 [7%] positive) during Delta and 7098 (2270 [32%] positive) during Omicron. Benchmarked against Delta, the vaccine effectiveness of 2 vaccine doses was lower during Omicron, with no significant protection against infection. Booster doses added significant protection, although they also showed reduced effectiveness during Omicron. Compared with findings in employees who had received 2 vaccine doses, 3 doses of BNT162b2 had a relative effectiveness of 50% (95% confidence interval, 42%-56%) during Omicron, relative to 78% (63%-87%) during Delta; 3 doses of mRNA1273 had a relative effectiveness of 56% (45%-65%) during Omicron, relative to 96% (82%-99%) during Delta. Restricting the sample to symptomatic tests yielded similar results to our primary analysis. After initial waning in BNT162b2 booster protection against infection, it remained largely stable for ≥16 weeks after vaccination. Conclusions: Our findings provide a strong rationale for boosters among healthcare workers in the Omicron era.},

We estimated BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness (VE) and a booster dose effectiveness in adolescents aged 12–17 years and the impact of opening schools and the Omicron variant on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents. Methods: We used logistic regression with a test-negative design controlling for gender and race to estimate BNT162b2 VE and the effectiveness of a booster dose in adolescents aged 12–17 years. To evaluate the effect of school opening on Omicron transmission, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to compare adolescents to a reference group of adults aged 22–33 or aged 65+ years, investigating whether risk for adolescents increased relative to the reference group after school opened. Results: We found that adolescents who received two BNT162b2 doses had significant protection against Omicron infection in the first three months following their second dose (VE = 54.5%, confidence interval [CI]: [17.8%–76.9%], p = .014) but no protection afterwards. Receiving a booster dose was associated with lower risk of infection (odds ratio = 0.48, CI: [0.33–0.69], p < .0001) and restored efficacy to a similar level (VE = 56.3%, CI: [36.5%–70.6%], p < .0001). We observed a statistically significant increase (p = .04) in adolescent infection risk relative to adults in the period of Omicron predominance. Discussion: The BNT162b2 vaccine is effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents but immunity against Omicron wanes rapidly and booster doses are needed to retain protection. More research is needed to determine the effect of school reopening on spread in the Omicron-dominant period.},

abstract = {Background: There is a lack of data regarding how the Delta variant of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson-Janssen) vaccines at preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: We compared the effectiveness of the three vaccines during the pre- and post-Delta variant period (before and after 1 July 2021) in a large cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in the Michigan Medicine healthcare system. We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) using 2 analyses: an inverse propensity weighted (IPW) Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis based on time from vaccination, and a Cox model based on calendar time with vaccination as a time-varying covariate. Results: Compared to Ad26.COV2.S recipients, the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 in the post-Delta variant period was lower for BNT162b2 recipients (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [.14-.98]; P = .05) and mRNA-1273 recipients (HR = 0.21; 95% CI: [.07-.64]; P = .006). Recipients of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than Ad26.COV2.S recipients (HR = 0.6; 95% CI: [.43-.83]; P = .003) and BNT162b2 recipients (HR = 0.64; 95% CI: [.54-.76]; P < .001). After 1 July, efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection declined for Ad26.COV2.S recipients (VE = 76% before; VE = 49% after; P = .02), BNT162b2 recipients (VE = 87% before; VE = 52% after; P < .001), and mRNA-1273 recipients (VE = 92% before; VE = 70% after; P < .001). Waning immunity and the Delta variant contributed independently and significantly to this decline. Conclusions: Although there is a substantial decline in effectiveness, the approved COVID-19 vaccines remain effective against infection and hospitalization due to the Delta variant. The mRNA-based vaccines are more effective than the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.},

abstract = {Importance: Systematic characterization of the protective effect of vaccinations across time and at-risk populations is needed to inform public health guidelines and personalized interventions. Objective: To evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) over time and determine differences across demographic and clinical risk factors of COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This test negative design consisted of adult patients who were tested or diagnosed for COVID-19 at Michigan Medicine in 2021. Variables extracted from Electronic Health Records included vaccination status, age, gender, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, body mass index, residential-level socioeconomic characteristics, past COVID-19 infection, being immunosuppressed, and health care worker status. Exposure: The primary exposure was vaccination status and was categorized into fully vaccinated with and without booster, partially vaccinated, or unvaccinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection with COVID-19 (positive test or diagnosis) and having severe COVID-19, i.e., either being hospitalized or deceased. Based on these, VE was calculated by quarter, vaccine, and patient characteristics. Results: Of 170,487 COVID-19 positive adult patients, 78,002 (45.8%) were unvaccinated, and 92,485 (54.2%) were vaccinated, among which 74,060 (80.1%) were fully vaccinated. COVID-19 positivity and severity rates were substantially higher among unvaccinated (12.1% and 1.4%, respectively) compared to fully vaccinated individuals (4.7% and 0.4%, respectively). Among 7,187 individuals with a booster, only 18 (0.3%) had a severe outcome. The covariate-adjusted VE against an infection was 62.1% (95%CI 60.3-63.8%), being highest in the Q2 of 2021 (90.9% [89.5-92.1%]), lowest in Q3 (60.1% [55.9-64.0%]), and rebounding in Q4 to 68.8% [66.3-71.1%]). Similarly, VE against severe COVID-19 overall was 73.7% (69.6-77.3%) and remained high throughout 2021: 87.4% (58.1-96.3%), 92.2% (88.3-94.8%), 74.4% (64.8-81.5%) and 83.0% (78.8-86.4%), respectively. Data on fully vaccinated individuals from Q4 indicated additional protection against infection with an additional booster dose (VE-Susceptibility: 64.0% [61.1-66.7%] vs. 87.3% [85.0-89.2%]) and severe outcomes (VE-Severity: 78.8% [73.5-83.0%] vs. 94.0% [89.5-96.6%]). Comparisons between Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines indicated similar protection against susceptibility (82.9% [80.7-84.9%] versus 88.1% [85.5-90.2%]) and severity (87.1% [80.3-91.6%]) vs. (84.9% [76.2-90.5%]) after controlling for vaccination timing and other factors. There was no significant effect modification by all the factors we examined. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccines offered high protection against infection and severe COVID-19, and showed decreasing effectiveness over time and improved protection with a booster.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the University of Michigan Precision Health Initiative, University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center, and Michigan Institute of Data Science.

abstract = {Recent laboratory and observational studies have demonstrated that the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness wanes over time. In response, several jurisdictions have authorized the administration of booster doses. Since August 13, 2021, Puerto Rico has administered 540,140 booster shots. We used data collected and made public by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) to evaluate the effectiveness of four different booster regimens at preventing SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed infections and adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed data from all 115,995 SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring since the vaccination process commenced on December 15, 2020. We combined vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths data, and fit a statistical model that adjusted for time-varying incidence rates and age group, to estimate time-varying vaccine effectiveness against infection and adverse outcomes. We find that, after 6 months, the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 effectiveness against infection wanes substantially to 61% (58%-63%) and 36% (34%-39%), respectively, while the Ad26.COV2.S wanes to 35% (31%-39%) after two months. However, after a booster shot of the corresponding initial vaccine manufacturer, effectiveness increased to 87% (83%-91%) and 82% (79%-85%) for mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, respectively. The effectiveness for Ad26.COV2.S followed by either a mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 booster increased to 88% (71%-100%), substantially higher than 65% (59%-70%), the peak effectiveness reached with just one shot. We also found that heterologous booster regimens restored effectiveness. Furthermore, we did not observe waning after two months of the booster shot. Finally, we found that all booster regimens provided increased protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.

abstract = {Background: On July 15, 2021, with 58% of the population fully vaccinated, the start of a COVID-19 surge was observed in Puerto Rico. On July 22, 2021, the government of Puerto Rico started imposing a series of strict vaccine mandates. Two months later, over 70% of the population was vaccinated, more than in any US state, and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 had dropped substantially. The decision to impose mandates, as well as current Department of Health recommendations related to boosters, were guided by the data and the effectiveness estimates presented here. Methods: Between December 15, 2020, when the vaccination process began in Puerto Rico, and October 15, 2021, 2,276,966 individuals were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. During this period 112,726 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported. These data permitted us to quantify the outcomes of the immunization campaign and to compare effectiveness of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT162b2 (Pfizer), and Ad26.COV2.S (J&J) vaccines. We obtained vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, from the Department of Health. We fit statistical models that adjusted for time-varying incidence rates and age group to estimate vaccine effectiveness, since the time of vaccination, against lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Results: Two weeks after final dose, the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines had an effectiveness of 90% (95% CI: 88–91), 87% (85–88), and, 64% (58–69), respectively. After five months, effectiveness waned to about 70%, 50%, and 40%, respectively. We found no evidence that effectiveness was different after the Delta variant became dominant. For those infected, the vaccines provided further protection against COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths across all age groups, and this conditional effect did not wane in time. Interpretation: The mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines were highly effective across all age groups. They were still effective after five months although the protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection waned. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was effective but to a lesser degree compared to the mRNA vaccines. Although, conditional on infection, protection against adverse outcomes did not wane, the waning in effectiveness resulted in a decreased protection against serious COVID-19 outcomes across time.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population-based data from the United States on the effectiveness of the three coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines currently authorized by the Food and Drug Administration are limited. Whether declines in effectiveness are due to waning immunity, the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or other causes is unknown. METHODS: We used data for 8,690,825 adults in New York State to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and hospitalization with Covid-19 (i.e., Covid-19 diagnosed at or after admission). We compared cohorts defined according to vaccine product received, age, and month of full vaccination with age-specific unvaccinated cohorts by linking statewide testing, hospital, and vaccine registry databases. We assessed vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 from May 1 through September 3, 2021, and against hospitalization with Covid-19 from May 1 through August 31, 2021. RESULTS: There were 150,865 cases of Covid-19 and 14,477 hospitalizations with Covid-19. During the week of May 1, 2021, when the delta variant made up 1.8% of the circulating variants, the median vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 91.3% (range, 84.1 to 97.0) for BNT162b2, 96.9% (range, 93.7 to 98.0) for mRNA-1273, and 86.6% (range, 77.8 to 89.7) for Ad26.COV2.S. Subsequently, effectiveness declined contemporaneously in all cohorts, from a median of 93.4% (range, 77.8 to 98.0) during the week of May 1 to a nadir of 73.5% (range, 13.8 to 90.0) around July 10, when the prevalence of the delta variant was 85.3%. By the week of August 28, when the prevalence of the delta variant was 99.6%, the effectiveness was 74.2% (range, 63.4 to 86.8). Effectiveness against hospitalization with Covid-19 among adults 18 to 64 years of age remained almost exclusively greater than 86%, with no apparent time trend. Effectiveness declined from May through August among persons 65 years of age or older who had received BNT162b2 (from 94.8 to 88.6%) or mRNA-1273 (from 97.1 to 93.7%). The effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S was lower than that of the other vaccines, with no trend observed over time (range, 80.0 to 90.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the three vaccines against Covid-19 declined after the delta variant became predominant. The effectiveness against hospitalization remained high, with modest declines limited to BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 recipients 65 years of age or older.},

abstract = {Background: The two-dose BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine has demonstrated high efficacy against COVID-19 disease in clinical trials of children and young people (CYP). Consequently, we investigated the uptake, safety, effectiveness and waning of the protective effect of the BNT162b2 against symptomatic COVID-19 in CYP aged 12–17 years in Scotland. Methods: The analysis of the vaccine uptake was based on information from the Turas Vaccination Management Tool, inclusive of Mar 1, 2022. Vaccine safety was evaluated using national data on hospital admissions and General Practice (GP) consultations, through a self-controlled case series (SCCS) design, investigating 17 health outcomes of interest. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic COVID-19 disease for Delta and Omicron variants was estimated using a test-negative design (TND) and S-gene status in a prospective cohort study using the Scotland-wide Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) surveillance platform. The waning of the VE following each dose of BNT162b2 was assessed using a matching process followed by conditional logistic regression. Findings: Between Aug 6, 2021 and Mar 1, 2022, 75.9% of the 112,609 CYP aged 16–17 years received the first and 49.0% the second COVID-19 vaccine dose. Among 237,681 CYP aged 12–15 years, the uptake was 64.5% and 37.2%, respectively. For 12–17-year-olds, BNT162b2 showed an excellent safety record, with no increase in hospital stays following vaccination for any of the 17 investigated health outcomes. In the 16–17-year-old group, VE against symptomatic COVID-19 during the Delta period was 64.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59.2–68.5) at 2–5 weeks after the first dose and 95.6% (77.0–99.1) at 2–5 weeks after the second dose. The respective VEs against symptomatic COVID-19 in the Omicron period were 22.8% (95% CI -6.4–44.0) and 65.5% (95% CI 56.0–73.0). In children aged 12–15 years, VE against symptomatic COVID-19 during the Delta period was 65.4% (95% CI 61.5–68.8) at 2–5 weeks after the first dose, with no observed cases at 2–5 weeks after the second dose. The corresponding VE against symptomatic COVID-19 during the Omicron period were 30.2% (95% CI 18.4–40.3) and 81.2% (95% CI 77.7–84.2). The waning of the protective effect against the symptomatic disease began after five weeks post-first and post-second dose. Interpretation: During the study period, uptake of BNT162b2 in Scotland has covered more than two-thirds of CYP aged 12–17 years with the first dose and about 40% with the second dose. We found no increased likelihood of admission to hospital with a range of health outcomes in the period after vaccination. Vaccination with both doses was associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of COVID-19 symptomatic disease during both the Delta and Omicron periods, but this protection began to wane after five weeks.

abstract = {Background: The Canadian coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immunization strategy deferred second doses and allowed mixed schedules. We compared 2-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) by vaccine type (mRNA and/or ChAdOx1), interval between doses, and time since second dose in 2 of Canada's larger provinces. Methods: Two-dose VE against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or hospitalization among adults ≥18 years, including due to Alpha, Gamma, and Delta variants of concern (VOCs), was assessed ≥14 days postvaccination by test-negative design studies separately conducted in British Columbia and Quebec, Canada, between 30 May and 27 November (epi-weeks 22-47) 2021. Results: In both provinces, all homologous or heterologous mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 2-dose schedules were associated with ≥90% reduction in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization risk for ≥7 months. With slight decline from a peak of >90%, VE against infection was ≥80% for ≥6 months following homologous mRNA vaccination, lower by ∼10% when both doses were ChAdOx1 but comparably high following heterologous ChAdOx1 + mRNA receipt. Findings were similar by age group, sex, and VOC. VE was significantly higher with longer 7-8-week versus manufacturer-specified 3-4-week intervals between mRNA doses. Conclusions: Two doses of any mRNA and/or ChAdOx1 combination gave substantial and sustained protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, spanning Delta-dominant circulation. ChAdOx1 VE against infection was improved by heterologous mRNA series completion. A 7-8-week interval between first and second doses improved mRNA VE and may be the optimal schedule outside periods of intense epidemic surge. Findings support interchangeability and extended intervals between SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses, with potential global implications for low-coverage areas and, going forward, for children.},

abstract = {Background: COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in the pandemic response and understanding changes in vaccines effectiveness is essential to guide vaccine policies. Although the Delta variant is no longer dominant, understanding vaccine effectiveness properties will provide essential knowledge to comprehend the development of the pandemic and estimate potential changes over time. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness of Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech; BNT162b2), Spikevax (Moderna; mRNA-1273), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca; ChAdOx nCoV-19; AZD1222), or a combination against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations, intensive care admissions, and death using Cox proportional hazard models, across different vaccine product regimens and age groups, between 15 July and 31 November 2021 (Delta variant period). Vaccine status is included as a time-varying covariate and all models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data from the entire adult Norwegian population were collated from the National Preparedness Register for COVID-19 (Beredt C19). Results: The overall adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection decreased from 81.3% (confidence interval (CI): 80.7 to 81.9) in the first 2 to 9 weeks after receiving a second dose to 8.6% (CI: 4.0 to 13.1) after more than 33 weeks, compared to 98.6% (CI: 97.5 to 99.2) and 66.6% (CI: 57.9 to 73.6) against hospitalisation respectively. After the third dose (booster), the effectiveness was 75.9% (CI: 73.4 to 78.1) against infection and 95.0% (CI: 92.6 to 96.6) against hospitalisation. Spikevax or a combination of mRNA products provided the highest protection, but the vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for all vaccine regimens. Conclusions: Even though the vaccine effectiveness against infection waned over time, all vaccine regimens remained effective against hospitalisation after the second vaccine dose. For all vaccine regimens, a booster facilitated recovery of effectiveness. The results from this support the use of heterologous schedules, increasing flexibility in vaccination policy.},

BNT162b2 effectiveness against any, symptomatic or asymptomatic, Delta infection was 45.3% (95% CI, 22.0–61.6%) ≥14 d after the first vaccine dose, but only 51.9% (95% CI, 47.0–56.4%) ≥14 d after the second dose, with 50% of fully vaccinated individuals receiving their second dose before 11 May 2021. Corresponding mRNA-1273 effectiveness ≥14 d after the first or second dose was 73.7% (95% CI, 58.1–83.5%) and 73.1% (95% CI, 67.5–77.8%), respectively. Notably, effectiveness against Delta-induced severe, critical or fatal disease was 93.4% (95% CI, 85.4–97.0%) for BNT162b2 and 96.1% (95% CI, 71.6–99.5%) for mRNA-1273 ≥ 14 d after the second dose. Our findings show robust effectiveness for both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in preventing Delta hospitalization and death in Qatar's population, despite lower effectiveness in preventing infection, particularly for the BNT162b2 vaccine.},

abstract = {Background: Vaccine effectiveness studies have not differentiated the effect of the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and potential waning immunity in observed reductions in effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections. We aimed to evaluate overall and variant-specific effectiveness of BNT162b2 (tozinameran, Pfizer–BioNTech) against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions by time since vaccination among members of a large US health-care system. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analysed electronic health records of individuals (≥12 years) who were members of the health-care organisation Kaiser Permanente Southern California (CA, USA), to assess BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions for up to 6 months. Participants were required to have 1 year or more previous membership of the organisation. Outcomes comprised SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tests and COVID-19-related hospital admissions. Effectiveness calculations were based on hazard ratios from adjusted Cox models. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04848584. Findings: Between Dec 14, 2020, and Aug 8, 2021, of 4 920 549 individuals assessed for eligibility, we included 3 436 957 (median age 45 years [IQR 29–61]; 1 799 395 [52{\textperiodcentered}4%] female and 1 637 394 [47{\textperiodcentered}6%] male). For fully vaccinated individuals, effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections was 73% (95% CI 72–74) and against COVID-19-related hospital admissions was 90% (89–92). Effectiveness against infections declined from 88% (95% CI 86–89) during the first month after full vaccination to 47% (43–51) after 5 months. Among sequenced infections, vaccine effectiveness against infections of the delta variant was high during the first month after full vaccination (93% [95% CI 85–97]) but declined to 53% [39–65] after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants the first month after full vaccination was also high at 97% (95% CI 95–99), but waned to 67% (45–80) at 4–5 months. Vaccine effectiveness against hospital admissions for infections with the delta variant for all ages was high overall (93% [95% CI 84–96]) up to 6 months. Interpretation: Our results provide support for high effectiveness of BNT162b2 against hospital admissions up until around 6 months after being fully vaccinated, even in the face of widespread dissemination of the delta variant. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infections over time is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection.

abstract = {Background: Globally, recommendations are expanding for third (booster) doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech). In the United States, as of November 19, 2021, boosters were recommended for all adults aged 18 years and older. We evaluated the effectiveness of a third dose of BNT162b2 among adults in a large US integrated health system. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern California between Dec 14, 2020 and Dec 5, 2021 to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two and three doses of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 infections (without hospital admission) andCOVID-19-related hospital admission. VE was calculated using hazards ratios from adjusted Cox models. Findings: After only two doses, VE against infection declined from 85% (95% CI 83–86) during the first month to 49% (46–51) ≥ 7 months following vaccination. Overall VE against hospitalization was 90% (95% CI 86–92) within one month and did not wane, however, effectiveness against hospitalization appeared to wane among immunocompromised individuals but was not statistically significant (93% [72–98] at 1 month to 74% [45–88] after ≥ 7 months; p=0{\textperiodcentered}490). Three-dose VE (median follow-up 1{\textperiodcentered}3 months [SD 0{\textperiodcentered}6]) was 88% (95% CI 86–89) against infection and 97% (95–98) against hospitalization. Effectiveness after three doses was higher than that seen one month after receiving only two doses for both outcomes. Relative VE of three doses compared to two (with at least six months after the second dose) was 75% (95% CI 71−78) against infections and 70% (48−83) against hospital admissions. Interpretation: These data support the benefit of broad BNT162b2 booster recommendations, as three doses confers comparable, if not better, protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections and hospital admission as was seen soon after receiving two doses.

abstract = {Background COVID-19 vaccination was recommended for adolescents in Norway since August 2021. In this population-based cohort study, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any PCR-confirmed (symptomatic or not) SARS-CoV-2 infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variant among adolescents (12-17-years-old) in Norway from August 2021 to January 2022.Methods Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against any Delta and Omicron infections. Vaccine status was included as a time-varying covariate and models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, county of residence, country of birth, and living conditions. Data were obtained from the National Preparedness registry for COVID-19, which contains individual-level data from national health and administrative registries.Findings Vaccine effectiveness against Delta infection peaked at 68% (95%CI: 64–71%) and 62% (95%CI: 57– 66%) in days 21-48 after the first dose among 12–15-year-olds and 16–17-year-olds respectively. Among 16–17-year-olds that received two doses, vaccine effectiveness peaked at 93% (95%CI: 90–95%) in days 35-62 and declined to 84% (95%CI: 76–89%) in 63 days or more after the second dose. For both age-groups, we found no protection against Omicron infection after receiving one dose. Among 16–17-year-olds, vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection peaked at 53% (95%CI: 43–62%) in 7-34 days after the second dose and decreased to 23% (95%CI: 3–40%) in 63 days or more after vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness decreased with time since vaccination for both variants, but waning was observed to occur faster for Omicron.Interpretation Our results suggest reduced protection from BNT162b2 vaccination against any SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant compared to the Delta. In addition, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance.Funding No funding was received.Evidence before this study BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax, Moderna) vaccines have been approved for use in adolescents, based on results from randomized placebo-controlled trials demonstrating comparable immunogenicity and safety profile as in young adults. In addition, observational studies from Israel, the USA and England have reported high protection of BNT162b2 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 Delta infection among adolescents. These studies also reported decrease in effectiveness with time since last vaccine dose. Evidence on the effect of an extended interval between doses, longer time since vaccination and the effect against different variants is limited. When we first planned this study in early February 2022, no data were available regarding vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection among adolescents. To our knowledge when we completed this study and before submitting this article, only one study from England reported results in a preprint on vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection among adolescents. We searched for studies that evaluated vaccine efficacy or effectiveness after vaccination of adolescents during 2021-2022 in PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN. We searched for studies with several variations of the primary key search terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, and “vaccine” (including names of specific vaccines, as BNT162b2), “vaccine effectiveness”, “adolescents”, “children”.Added value of this study The rapid increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the Omicron variant in highly vaccinated populations has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines in adults but also adolescents. In this population-based cohort study, we showed that the vaccine effectiveness against Omicron is lower than against Delta infections among adolescents, including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We should note that evidence suggests higher rates of asymptomatic carriage for Omicron than other variants of concern. Vaccine effectiveness that includes asymptomatic cases, as in the study from England, is expected to be lower than when including symptomatic cases only. We found that one and two doses of BNT162b2 among adolescents protected well against Delta. Vaccination provided high protection against Delta infections (&gt;91%) among Norwegian 16-17-year-olds 7-62 days after the second dose. We found no protection against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection after one vaccine dose, and moderate effectiveness after two doses (peaked at 53%) among the 16-17-year-olds. Moreover, waning immunity was observed to occur faster for Omicron.Implications of all the available evidence Based on the available evidence, the vaccine effectiveness among adolescents is similar to that reported among adults, also with an extended period of 8-12 weeks between doses which was used in Norway. Protection is significantly lower against Omicron than Delta infections and immunity wanes faster against Omicron. The impact of vaccination among adolescents on reducing infection and thus transmission is limited during omicron dominance. Policies should take into account the impact of vaccination campaigns among adolescents and their primary objective. Vaccine effectiveness should be re-evaluated when other variants appear as they might have different outcomes as shown between Delta and Omicron infections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not‒for‒profit sectors.

I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).Yes I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.YesThe dataset analysed in the study contains individual‒level linked data from various central health registries, national clinical registries, and other national administrative registries in Norway. The researchers had access to the data through the national emergency preparedness registry for COVID‒19 (Beredt C19), housed at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). In Beredt C19, only fully anonymised data (i.e. data that are neither directly nor potentially indirectly identifiable) are permitted to be shared publicly. Legal restrictions therefore prevent the researchers from publicly sharing the dataset used in the NH study that would enable others to replicate the study findings. However, external researchers are freely able to request access to linked data from the same registries from outside the structure of Beredt C19, as per normal procedure for conducting health research on registry data in Norway. Further information on Beredt C19, including contact information for the Beredt C19 project manager, and information on access to data from each individual data source, is available at https://www.fhi.no/en/id/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/emergency-preparedness-register-for-covid-19/.},

@article{Voko_2022,
abstract = {Background: In late 2021, the pandemic wave was dominated by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant in Hungary. Booster vaccines were offered for the vulnerable population starting from August 2021. Methods: The nationwide HUN-VE 3 study examined the effectiveness and durability of primary immunization and single booster vaccinations in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Covid-19 related hospitalization and mortality during the Delta wave, compared to an unvaccinated control population without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: The study population included 8,087,988 individuals who were 18–100 years old at the beginning of the pandemic. During the Delta wave, after adjusting for age, sex, calendar day, and chronic diseases, vaccine effectiveness (VE) of primary vaccination against registered SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 11% to 77% and 18% to 79% 14–120 days after primary immunization in the 16–64 and 65–100 years age cohort respectively, while it decreased to close to zero in the younger age group and around 40% or somewhat less in the elderly after 6 months for almost all vaccine types. In the population aged 65–100 years, we found high, 88.1%–92.5% adjusted effectiveness against Covid-19 infection after the Pfizer-BioNTech, and 92.2%–95.6% after the Moderna booster dose, while Sinopharm and Janssen booster doses provided 26.5%–75.3% and 72.9%–100.0% adjusted VE, respectively. Adjusted VE against Covid-19 related hospitalization was high within 14–120 days for Pfizer-BioNTech: 76.6%, Moderna: 83.8%, Sputnik-V: 78.3%, AstraZeneca: 73.8%, while modest for Sinopharm: 45.7% and Janssen: 26.4%. The waning of protection against Covid-19 related hospitalization was modest and booster vaccination with mRNA vaccines or the Janssen vaccine increased adjusted VE up to almost 100%, while the Sinopharm booster dose proved to be less effective. VE against Covid-19 related death after primary immunization was high or moderate: for Pfizer-BioNTech: 81.5%, Moderna: 93.2%, Sputnik-V: 100.0%, AstraZeneca: 84.8%, Sinopharm: 58.6%, Janssen: 53.3%). VE against this outcome also showed a moderate decline over time, while booster vaccine types restored effectiveness up to almost 100%, except for the Sinopharm booster. Conclusions: The HUN-VE 3 study demonstrated waning VE with all vaccine types for all examined outcomes during the Delta wave and confirmed the outstanding benefit of booster vaccination with the mRNA or Janssen vaccines, and this is the first study to provide clear and comparable effectiveness results for six different vaccine types after primary immunization against severe during the Delta pandemic wave.},

abstract = {The durability of immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination will drive long-term vaccine effectiveness across settings and may differ by vaccine type. To determine durability of protection of COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S) following primary vaccination in the United States, a matched case-control study was conducted in three cohorts between 1 January and 7 September 2021 using de-identified data from a database covering 168 million lives. Odds ratios (ORs) for developing outcomes of interest (breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or intensive care unit admission) were determined for each vaccine (no direct comparisons). In total, 17,017,435 individuals were identified. Relative to the baseline, stable protection was observed for Ad26.COV2.S against infections (OR [95% confidence interval (CI)], 1.31 [1.18–1.47]) and hospitalizations (OR [95% CI], 1.25 [0.86–1.80]). Relative to the baseline, protection waned over time against infections for BNT162b2 (OR [95% CI], 2.20 [2.01–2.40]) and mRNA-1273 (OR [95% CI], 2.07 [1.87–2.29]) and against hospitalizations for BNT162b2 (OR [95% CI], 2.38 [1.79–3.17]). Baseline protection remained stable for intensive care unit admissions for all three vaccines. Calculated baseline VE was consistent with published literature. This study suggests that the three vaccines in three separate populations may have different durability profiles.},
